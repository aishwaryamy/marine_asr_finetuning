Next is starboard number one.
Next, the tank is an overall very good condition, comma, with good coatings and light silt.
Period.
Next, bay two.
Between the five and six is a light dent, and between the number seven and eight is a light crease with the paint broken.
Period.
Let's go back, bay one.
Between the one and three side shell longitudinals is a light set in, with the number two longitudinal lightly set in.
Period.
Next, next at the number four, in bay, next is Bay four.
Next is the side shell, the number three, two and three longitudinals are likely set in.
Next, between the number seven and eight side shell longitudinals is a area of moderate dishing, comma, three feet long by a foot wide.
Period.
Next, in the aft end of that same longitudinal frame bay is a sharp, local indent, moderate, only approximately four inches by four inches by approximately one inch deep at the aft end.
Period.
Next.
Next bay five, next.
The number three side shell longitudinal is lightly set in.
Next, between the number seven and eight are four areas of light set in.
Next at the mud slope, a significant repair in bays one and two, extending into bay three.
Next in Bay three is a light set in at mid-bay to the mud log.
Next Bay five.
At mid-Bay is a light set in and crease.
Period.
Next is starboard number three.
Next, the tank is in overall a very good condition, comma, with good coatings and light silt.
Period.
As a general note, the mud log has been repaired slash renewed in bays three, four, and five.
Period.
Next, at the bottom shell, the bottom is set up longitudinally, starting in Bay two, between the, between the five and six bottom longitudinals, extending to bay, extending to bay six, comma, with the bottom transverse deep frames knuckled in way of the bottom plate setup.
Period.
The setup is considered moderate at approximately one inch, comma, and the paint has been chipped, cleaned, and recoated.
Period.
Next.
Bay three.
Next.
Between the six and eight side shell longitudinals are three, excuse me, four dents, moderate dents, excuse me.
There are three moderate dent to the side shell and one heavy dent at the forward portion between the number seven and eight.
Period.
That heavy dent is approximately one and a half inches in, and one foot by, two feet by two feet.
eighteen inches by eighteen inches, let's say.
Next, at bay six at the mud log, the mud log is lightly dished between previous repairs.
Period.
Next, in bay six are light, random dents to the hopper, with no structure affected.
Period.
Next is starboard number five.
Next, in bay one at the side shell, there's a heavy set in between the number two and four side longitudinals, with the number three longitudinal heavily set in.
Period.
This set in is about two to two and a half inches deep, and about, the dent is probably three feet by five feet.
Period.
Next, bay two next, at the side longitudinal under the number three is a light local dent forward.
Period.
Next, Bay four next.
Between the four, between the three, excuse me, let's start again.
Bay three, at the side shell, between the number two and four side longitudinals, are a series of dents and set ins, comma, four in number.
Period.
These all appear to be moderate with the exception of an aft, a dent in the aft bay, under the number three longitudinal, which appears heavy, one foot by two foot.
Period.
Next bay six.
Next between the number three and four side longitudinals, just forward of mid bay, is a moderate crease, approximately one foot in length and one foot wide.
Next, as a general note, there is a longitudinal setup through the entire tank, between the six and seven bottom longitudinals.
setup is considered generally moderate at one to one and a half inches, with each of the transverse deep frames heavily knuckled in way fo the dent.
Period.
The paint has been cleaned, and the dent is repainted, with the exception of a heavier set up and crease at the, in bay six, and against the aft bulkhead, where the aft bulkhead is knuckled over the lower eight inches.
Period.
Now, this area has not been painted.
Period.
Next, the mud log appears unremarkable in that fully in bays three, four, five, and six the mud lug has been replaced, along with some associated transverse framing, and there is no new notable damage.
Period.
Next, in Bay two at the mud log, the mud log is lightly creased at mid-height.
Period.
Next, let's go back to Bay one at the vertical, at the, at the hopper vertical slope, intersect with the mud slope, at the the forward bulkhead is a light dent approximately two feet by two feet.
Period.
And continuing in the forward rake, between the number six and seven, comma, in way that longitudinal dent, comma, the forward bulkhead is heavily knuckled at the bottom shell, period.
