Number one, I’ll put it right there into bay six, bay two, bay one.
Forward bulkhead, good.
One foot of rust on the bottom, light rust.
Forward bulkhead, good.
One and a half feet of rust except in the ladderway.
The starboard bulkhead, good.
There’s less than an inch of water on the deck, mixed with muck and scale.
Light to moderate scale condition.
Transverse frames—let’s get that overhead.
Good coating, two undersurface discrepancies.
Undersurface discrepancies in transverse frames.
Bring that side across.
Keep it heavy.
You’re too light.
When water hits it, it mops.
Forward starboard bulkhead, good.
Some rust on the bottom.
Forward bulkhead, good.
Some rust, overhead—good coating on the frames.
Bottom longitudes have light to moderate scale.
Good condition.
Transverse frame is in good condition at the top, light rust at the bottom.
Starboard bulkhead, good.
Some rust on the bottom.
Frames between bays three and four are in fair shape.
The forward corner should be assigned for renewal—looks like they did it that way.
Bottom framing looks like a box of paper.
No water, just scale on the bottom.
Both bulkheads good, bottom rust fair.
Bays one, two, three, four, from port.
Deck, some loose stone, sugar paint.
Deck work looks American.
Coating elsewhere is the same.
Good coating, same on transverse frames.
Bilge damp—no standing water, just oily residue.
Frames are the same.
I’m also trying to check if I’m going to rely on foot access.
Bay six, aft bulkhead—condition fair, rust on bottom one foot.
Starboard bulkhead, good condition all the way over.
Port bulkhead basis between bays two and three—longitudinals have about one foot of moderate rust inset that was put in.
Looks like a top plate.
Number one center rank divided into two bays by one frame.
Longitudinals show a lot of rust.
Bay one—deck in bay one is on a slope.
Generally good coating.
White rust on the bottom.
Starboard bulkhead looks good.
Overhead and paint coatings are good.
All frames look good.
Moving to the port side of the compartment again, looking at the forward bulkhead—all frames look good, no dents noted.
Overhead looks good.
Bottom looks good.
Bay two—outboard bulkhead, good.
This bay has three inches of water mixed with scale at the bottom of the rake.
Aft bulkhead—make that six inches of water.
Aft bulkhead looks good on the top, some light rusting.
Bottom 18 inches shows light to moderate scale.

Port rake also divided into two bays.
Bay two—outboard bulkhead, no indentations.
Frames are good.
Coating’s good.
Bottom two feet show light rust.
Overhead—the frame is in good condition.
No water in this bay, just a six-inch pile of scale at the bottom of the rake.
Trying to step in and continue inspection.
Bottom longitudes are good, but the last two feet really need cleaning.
Aft bulkhead has heavy scaling.
Aft bulkhead is in good condition, moderate scaling on longitudes and bulkhead bottom two feet.
Transverse frame is in good condition.
Overhead in good condition.
Starboard bulkhead in good condition.
A1 bay—rust on all deck and framing.
Coating’s generally intact.
Remaining paint is good.
Bulkhead frames all good.
Coated, just some cool spots.
Moving into port one.
Port one again—six bays.
Bay A2 on the outboard side is the sump well.
A1—no water on the bottom, probably at least a half-inch layer of scale.
Bottom longitudes, particularly number two, have slight wastage along the upper edge.
That’s what the longitudinal looks like—just covered in scale.
Outboard bulkhead—correction—inboard bulkhead in good condition, good coating.
Ladderway has rust.
Forward bulkhead similar, except heavier areas of rust in way of ladderway.
Overhead good, coatings good.
Outboard coating again not so good.
Over bottom two feet—light rust coating.
Transverse frame coating in good condition—light rust in two stated spots.
Again, pile of scale at the bottom.
The bottom longitudes are fair, with higher scaling.
Both bulkheads good.
Bottom three feet—light rust with scaling at the bottom.
Good.
I’m going to put this on the cover.
Bottom longitudes are close in shape.
Everything else—same as before.
Bay four—pretty much the same.

Outboard overhead and frames—good condition.
Paint coating’s good.
Concrete looks good.
Bottom longitudes don’t look good—moderate scaling.
Overhead looks good.
Good coatings.
Transverse frame between bays one and two—good.

Bay two—also water and mud, about an inch.
Unless I say otherwise, everything is good with good coatings and light rusting at the bottom two feet.
Bay three—just muck and water.
Good.
Good.

Aft end has a rust spot.
And now we’ve just got the seats—besides, same as the others.
Thank you.
