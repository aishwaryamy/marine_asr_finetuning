How long have you been fishing Ricardo?
20 years.
20 years.
And you're the captain on the?
21 almost 21 yeah.
You're the captain on the Vila Do Conde?
Yes I am.
Yep.
How long you been captain?
Since 2017.
Okay, so three years.
I ran the boat NUGGET.
And Levi here's your mate?
Yes.
How many guys you have aboard on Friday?
Seven.
Seven total?
Total.
You were going on a closed area trip?
Yes.
Alright, when did you come to New Bedford to get on the boat for this trip?
We packed out, what was that?
Monday.
We packed out.
It was Monday.
Monday at 6:30.
Monday at 6:30 in the morning.
In the morning.
Yep.
And we were.
Let's see, we left on Thursday.
No, we ended up.
It was Thursday.
Yeah, it was Thursday morning.
We were supposed to leave Wednesday, right?.
We left.
we were going to leave Wednesday but we ended up leaving Thursday, Thursday afternoon.
We left.
Yeah, it wasn't Friday, sorry about that.
All right, so you packed up, you were on the boat all week.
I stayed, I stayed, a couple guys went home, go pay taxes, I stayed with the boat.
Okay.
And what time do you leave on Thursday?
We left, what time was it exactly?
Oh, I feel awful.
Yeah, we returned the car, it was three, something, four o'clock.
About four o'clock, 16-00?
Yeah.
How long had the engine been running when you departed the dock?
How long had the main been on?
The main?
Not long.
You had it running, doing gear work while I was food shopping, and when I got back, it was off.
I started everything and.
Time was that, you fired it up?
I'd say like three, three-thirty?
So it was running about a half an hour?
And who's the engineer on the boat?
You are Ricardo?
Pretty much.
Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah.
And you checked everything in the engine room?
Yes.
When was the last time you were in the engine room?
Before the fire?
Yeah, before the fire.
Before the first?
I was in there when I started it, I was in there right before the fire, right before I went to bed, I changed the fuel over, okay.
I switched the fuel to the other side.
Yup.
Okay, and I went to bed.
At that point, you could smell nothing, there is nothing is going on in there.
And how long had that been?
What time was that, you went to bed, you remember?
I laid down, what was it, after Quicks, right?
Yeah, I made Quicks turn, and then I laid down.
So you were only a couple hours into the trip?
Yeah, not even, so from, from, from New Bedford, came through the barrier, turned to Quicks, the first turn there?
Yeah.
Started heading up, I laid down.
By the time we got above the Nantucket, that's when it happened.
Oh, you were all the way to Nantucket?
Yeah.
Right, we're almost getting out to the offshore.
Almost made it offshore.
So that's more than a couple hours.
Huh?
Made it out to Martha's Vineyard.
Well, now, Martha's Vineyard, and then we.
The boat, it takes two hours, two fifteen minutes to go over there.
Yeah, yeah, you guys, yeah, you're doing what?
Ten knots?
Oh, we're doing like almost eleven knots.
Twelve.
Yeah.
Eleven to twelve knots.
So you're an hour and a half to get to Quicks'.
You make the, you turn to port at Quicks', you head down, you make East Chop, and head towards Nantucket.
Exactly.
So you gotta be three, three and a half hours into it.
Yup.
If you're already that way.
Yeah, okay.
So you discover that, you were in the engine right before the fire because you went down to change over the fuel?
Mm-hmm.
What does that involve?
Just changing a couple of valves.
Why?
Why?
Yeah.
Because you're burning from one side to the other side to keep the boat level.
Okay, but you've only been under way a few hours.
But the generator's been running while, while I was out, on.
Oh, okay.
On land.
Oh, you had.
So I had a generator running off the one side, and that.
Oh, okay.
That burns a lot slower.
So I can go days of burning off.
Okay.
Of one side without even getting the slightest list in the boat.
Okay, just a generator.
Right or wrong?
So you switch from which side to which side?
I went from the port side to starboard side.
Starboard side, yeah.
No, no, from starboard side to port side.
Where's the manifold for that?
Where do you do that?
The valves?
There's three spots where you go.
You have the main feeds from port to starboard.
You have the returns from, yeah, you have two returns and two main feeds.
Okay, but they're in the engine room forward in the engine room?
There's one forward, there's one in the back, and there's one at the front of the main engine.
Okay.
And that door, the watertight door to the machine shop forward, that was closed, it looks like.
That was closed.
That's, that's the right thing to do.
So you go up, you go to bed.
And what's the next thing you know?
I get woken up to.
By who?
By John Walker.
John Walker.
He's one of the deckheads?
Yes.
He's been fishing for probably 16 years at least.
And what's John tell you?
John, John smelled the fire when he looked first.
Yep.
And then woke me up and told me that there's an actual fire.
Okay.
He alerted the whole boat.
He alerted the whole boat, he went individually to each room and told everybody to get up.
Everybody gets up.
And what'd you do then?
I went to go see the fire.
I opened the hatch and he already had the fire extinguisher in his hands.
I opened the hatch and it back drafted.
Yeah, hang on a sec.
So you grab, you had one fire extinguisher.
Yeah, I grabbed one, my brother grabbed one.
Yup.
Everybody was grabbing fire extinguishers.
We, they each had one.
I, I'm the furthest in the companionway.
I had that door shut because I like, I don't like people to like almost fall in there.
Keep the door shut.
To the engine room?
To the engine room?
Right.
And had my fan running.
Okay.
Yup.
My breather fan, which cools down the engine room.
Sure.
But it also sends oxygen in through, through the vents.
Feed the fire.
Exactly.
So when we opened it, it looked like nothing but as soon as we got it open enough it took off.
It was like, whoosh.
So we shut it, and they were shooting at that same time.
Yup.
When it backtracked into the room, we all, it singed his arm hairs and stuff and everything, and we all went running out.
That's when I called the mayday.
Okay.
That's when I knew I knew it was it was time for a mayday.
I ran up there, I hailed the mayday, I gave my position and I said I can't stand here and talk to you.
I'm not losing my guys or my boat.
I got to fight this fire.
And by then I mean I was in a perfect spot.
I was still close to land.
I mean they made it there within minutes.
Coach Guard did?
Yes.
They made it there, by the time I had the fire out like literally I did, it went, it wasn't that quick, but we went through everything.
Yeah, they were overhead while we were still burning.
The helicopter was there, a cutter, first a small boat was there, then a cutter.
You guys showing a lot of smoke or not?
Yeah, because my exhaust fan at the time was on and that's blowing out.
And you're blowing all the soot up?
I mean, straight trail.
And, um.
So you were easy to find?
Yeah, well, there was a boat right behind me now too.
Who was that?
Oh, who was it?
Green and black boat.
But um.
It's alright, if you think of it.
So, you guys?
A sporty came up to us too.
Yep.
Okay.
But you had the fire out by then.
But it was, it was out, but we weren't like, we weren't a hundred percent certain.
We already got hit with a backdraft.
Right.
Because it looked like...
When we made the mayday call, we started, we started, we started.
I told them, I told them cover every vent.
Closing the vents down.
Cover every vent.
Take your aprons, cover the vents, clog up all the vents.
And at this time I didn't know that it went from electrical to fuel fire because my sight glasses on the wall are only two or three feet from where the fire started from the solenoid starter.
So the sight glasses melted?
Melted and started pouring out fuel.
The valves weren't shut off on the sight glasses?
No.
I'm looking in to get spring valves there.
Good idea.
So I see a couple, two or three spent extinguishers on the boat, maybe there were, how many do you use all together, you think?
Probably two or three?
Yeah, I use one, my brother had one.
There's a couple more sitting there that are full, the grenade you didn't use.
The grenade we went to use, okay?
We went to use but it didn't go off because it was out already by that time.
Oh.
Like they throw it in there in case it was just, them things actually cool down a room to help to help, I mean, I mean, I burnt my leg just trying to go down there to shut off the fuel.
But we drove down there and it didn't, it's already out by then.
It didn't melt the, it didn't melt the little tabs.
The litte plastic tabs.
It wasn't hot enough to melt the tabs on the grenade.
The fire was out.
So once we could see, like, we got it out, we knew it was out, but the smoke was so heavy still.
We still could not see anything in there.
So we knew it was out.
There was no flames.
We were able to open the door and have the cloud of smoke come right in our faces and kind of step back a little bit.
And then, you know, that's when we're just like, you know what, close it, let it come out high, you know, out of the, our exhaust thing.
We didn't cover the fan part.
We only covered the suction part where it goes in, not where it blows out.
So it was pulling down through the hatch, probably.
Yeah, it was pulling down through the hatch a little bit.
But it was still coming out.
We let it, the Coast Guard now is on the boat, a male and a female, came off the small orange boats, the little gold, boats, yeah.
And at the time, he's just asked if we're okay, you know, and everything, and he's like, where's the survival suits?
We already had them on the stern, like he walked right by them, they were already on the stern.
In the midst of all this, I barked out a few orders, and for a couple of guys to do certain things.
And a couple of guys went and grabbed the E, one guy went and grabbed the EPIRB.
A couple of guys grabbed his brother and a kid, Shawn, grabbed the suits or, was it Shawn?
One of the guys.
They grabbed the suits.
And I was in the process of trying to shut that exhaust fan off.
He was shutting, he was closing the vents with the aprons.
Once I could see down there and see, I seen the fuel pouring out.
And I seen where the fire, where the sparks were, where.
That was like right before Coast Guard.
OK, somebody here to see you, Tony.
So who else, that was, what's your brother's name?
Daniel.
Daniel.
Daniel?
And who's Shawn?
Shawn Stone.
Stone?
Yeah.
And who's the last guy?
One, two.
Who was it?
Three, four five.
Allan.
Allan.
Two more.
Allan.
Allan and Daniel.
Dominguez.
Dominguez.
What are their last names?
Do you know?
Daniel Brockman and Daniel Dominguez.
Oh, Daniel's a Brockman?
Yeah.
And then there's Allen.
What's Allen's last name?
Don't know?
Allen.
Both.
Both.
B-O-O-T-H. Booth.
Booth.
Ok, and Dominguez?
And Daniel Dominguez.
What's Dominguez' last name?
Daniel Dominguez.
Oh, so Ricardo, Levi, Daniel.
There's two Daniels.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Oh, there's another Daniel.
Daniel Dominguez, yes.
Oh, Daniel Dominguez.
Yeah, gotcha.
And Daniel Brockman.
And Daniel Brockman.
There's two Daniels.
So you didn't shut down the main, the main stayed running.
So.
And when you went down there and the engine room is clear, could you, when did you determine or what made you think it was the starter that caused the fire?
Well, when I looked from where it was coming from, okay, when I looked down there, I couldn't see the starter.
But when I went to shut off the fuel, okay, because the fuel was pouring out, and that's where the fire basically was at right there.
Right there at the bottom of the ladder, right?
In the beginning I thought it was maybe like the compressor's right there, there's a welder right there, you know, but it wasn't underneath the, it was down further, it was like right there, like more towards the engine kinda.
What was more towards the engine?
The fire, like when it.
Where the flames were coming from.
Because when we opened it, it was, it was subtle, and then when we let the oxygen in, by opening it, it's when we seen that flame come up.
So it's coming up from the area of the starter.
Yes, right there, right there, and it came right up, and when I went down there, let's see, when I went down there the first time was, I realized I'm in gear now.
I'm in gear and I'm stuck in gear.
The sticks ain't working, right they melted, at the time.
And when they cooled off, I was able to use, still use the throttle, but the transmission, I could not.
I couldn't take it out of gear, couldn't put it in gear.
That I had to do manually.
I got her in a neutral.
Manually meaning you had to go down to the engine room to do it?
Yes, and I had to go down the engine room and force it into, into neutral.
In my head, I was trying to shut everything down.
I wanted it to shut down because I still thought there could be danger still with the engine running.
But then again, I was like, you know what?
As long as she's running, I could probably still get her back.
Right.
If I shut her down, I probably wouldn't get her back, cause the starter's shot.
She wouldn't start again.
She wouldn't start again.
So that's when I, because I had cut off all the fuel to everything, I tried to starve her from fuel to shut her down because I didn't want to go on to a shoal or or, I wanted to be slowly moving.
You were trying to hit the switch, but it was.
Yeah, I was trying to, I was, I was trying to hit the switch with a, with a, an actual gaff, I have a gaff, yeah, and I didn't want to go down there at the time cause there was fuel and it was still real hot.
I tried to step down there, and I burnt my leg on the back of my leg with the step.
Is it, you burnt yourself badly or just a little?
Just a little, yup, yup.
It's raised, it's raised enough.
Yep.
But that's just from me touching, coming close to it, I barely even touched the back of the step, the first step going down.
Hot.
They were hot.
They were really hot.
Anybody else come down to the engine besides you, right then?
No.
No.
The Coast Guard went with me.
He gave, when he did get on the boat, at this time, like, everything shuts, slowly shutting down.
The engine's getting down to like almost 200 RPMs.
It was probably running on oil at this time.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Some of them will do that.
Because I had starved it from fuel, and I'm thinking, I'm like, do I really want to see the stall?
And I'm looking at the outriggers, I'm like, no.
I go down there and I put the fuel, because I had shut off the fuel from both sides because it was leaking everywhere.
I opened it up from the other side, okay?
Where, because now I have a list, because I poured some out.
There was no fire on the starboard side.
No, there was no fire.
But it was big enough to hit some spots.
It got black enough and covered some area.
Oh yeah.
It melted the lights right off the ceiling over there.
It looked spooky.
Because the heat all went up.
Yeah.
And all the lights just.
So your hydraulics are on your main engine.
Yes.
So you need to, you wanted to keep the, keep the main engine going to get your riggers out.
Yeah.
So the first step I did, once I thought about it, because I kept pacing back and forth, and I was thinking and just kept coming up with my next step, my next step, my next step.
So by then, I felt safe, everybody felt safe, the Coast Guard was on there, I was breaking everything down to him and I was like, alright, now, here's what we gotta do.
I'm gonna turn on the fuel to the engine, I'm gonna get this engine running, back up running at a normal idle, because she was slowly, slowly, slowly getting down, down and down and down.
Now before she stalled out, I was like, you know what?
No, I'm not doing that.
So I started that up.
I put the PTO in by hand because our compressor was damn near melted.
I had no air in it, in the system to push the button.
And used a PTO, pushed a PTO in in by air, we have an air ramp that pushes in that.
So we had none of that, so I pushed it in by hand.
I had changed my valve for my outriggers in the hydrologic section and went up there, pulled my outriggers up first thing.
And this time you're still all in neutral?
Still in neutral, yeah.
In neutral because at first we were going in circles.
Right, right.
Is Coast Guard still there or they left now?
No, he's there.
He's there.
He had come down with me.
He put one of his gas and oxygen detectors that he carries on him.
He put it on me.
He asked me to wear it.
He's like, if you go down there again, because he was all nervous after he had seen.
Yeah, you might have starved the oxygen out of the air, right?
He was nervous and I mean, I was only going in there small spurts, like run in there, do what I gotta do, run out.
Yup.
Run in there, do what I gotta do, run out.
And just small spurts, come out, you know, well I take my time to think about what needed to be done and make sure I thought it through well and then go, you know, attack it.
But I got the, I got the outriggers up, and then I'm thinking okay well, if they're up, and I still got power propulsion, let me check my steering.
I went to check the steering.
At, at first the generator had had went into a safe mode, kind of, it shut everything off on the boat, okay, it wasn't given no electric to anything and it went into a safe mode and then it was running still but nothing was being powered.
I, so I shut them down.
I was nervous about, you know, them.
I wasn't too sure what to do in that situation.
So I shut them down.
And then once I had seen that the, like, there was still smoke there, I'm still walking through here with smoke, once it got more clearer, more clearer, I was like, okay, well, I have generators, so let me see if I have steering.
You know, if I can, because, I wanted to, the fire was so close to my steering pumps right there, right there by the steps, that I, I didn't know what to think of that, you know, like seized up from the heat or anything.
It was right under the stairs, right?
Right there, right there.
On the port side against the fuel tank, under the stairs.
Yeah, alright.
So that was my next thing.
I switched generators for a moment and then I switched generators so on the, on the box panel there's a thing to shut off the electric, you know, the generator from one side to the other.
----------------------------------------------
I did that, and then I was like, you know what, wires, a lot of wires on that side, for that generator.
Let me not mess with this generator, let me go back to the generator I was on, okay.
So I, I took, shut it down with the emergency stop, I turned it on, I hit the button, I watched everything go to normal, and do a check on it on itself and then I started it up, and at first I was like, wait a second.
And I forgot to switch the things over.
The things, yeah.
So I switched them over.
What things are those?
It's just two switches for port or starboard.
Oh, to give you.
Give you power.
I had them both off.
Yeah, I had them both off because I was nervous at the time.
I didn't know what to do yet.
I had them both off.
I was like, wait a second.
Something's not right here.
And I, boom, clicked that on.
I had gone through all the panels and shut off unnecessary things.
You know?
Because at the time I didn't know what wires went to where.
Well, what was, what was burned and what was shorted?
What was burned, exactly.
I didn't want to spark.
I was with the Coast Guard guy just walking around, escort.
I was going around, I was like, look, I don't need this.
No, no, no.
No bunk rooms or nothing.
I didn't need nothing, nope, on.
So I did that.
That was one of the things I did first.
So it's hard.
They happen so fast and it's hard to think.
Yeah.
You know, that's okay.
And had you called for a tow or anything at that time?
We were, my dad, my dad got.
Because of Kevin?
Kevin reached him before I got told.
Kevin?
Kevin, from... Kevin McLaughlin.
He got to my dad before, before I did.
He overheard it and he called my dad.
He went, he went, he went in the computer and found the phone and called my dad.
He heard the mayday.
At the time I was still trying to attack my, you know, I didn't have a moment to think.
You wanted to get the, save the boat.
Yeah, I didn't have a moment to think.
You know.
Everything was diverted towards the boat.
So once I got everything, we got the generator back running, I got some electric, my computers came on, I seen like a haul plot line, I went up, check this, check the autopilot, autopilot didn't work, because my, my indicator, my rudder indicator that goes from the wheelhouse all the way to the stern to the little thing that indicates, yeah that burned up, tells you where its at.
That wire is shot.
So that was throwing a code to my autopilot, but my, my little solenoids in the, my little hydraulic pump on the steering, on the actual wheel, that is just, that's like, it's not digital, it's not electric, it's just you turn it and it pumps, and it pumps oil.
Which is oil, right.
You know.
And it felt good so we all did a conga line to check to make sure it was.
Yeah I told it, I said everybody get in line, tell me if it, you know, tell me if it's turning, you know what I mean, if its turning properly, if it's not like hesitant or anything, boom, they're like yeah its turning normal.
So that's when I went downstairs, and you know, I popped her back in gear.
Yep.
And.
So what time did you get in through the barrier?
Do you rememeber?
It was what, almost midnight.
Midnight, you get back to the barrier?
Almost midnight, yeah.
You told me, it was almost 11.30.
11:30 yeah, it was almost.
And Kevin came out.
11:30.
I'll tell you right now what time I called you.
Becuase we were pulling up at the dock.
I pulled her out of gear, I pulled her out of gear right, right before I called my dad and he was hooking up to the, the Jaguar.
Jaguar.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, listen, Charlie was coming out there to get me and I said, hey Charlie, you know, like no offense, but you know, like in my eyes I'm thinking, this is costing enough, this is already bad enough that we can't make the trip.
If I can have him just guide me through Quicks, get in front of me and had give me a good heading, be in front of me, be my lights.
He met you out at Quicks?
He came through Woods Hole and jumped in front of me.
Oh okay.
He caught up to me and jumped in front of me.
Okay.
And, because the boat was moving pretty well.
We were doing like seven knots and he, he came, came behind me.
I said, I called him on the.
We were taking like half power.
He was gonna, he was, he wanted, he was going to come there and just hook up and take over.
When he got through Woods Hole, he called the Coast Guard and said, hey, I can relieve you guys.
You guys have been, they been following us and standing there.
They couldn't do much anyway at the time.
He relieved then and that's when he got in front of me right at the turn at Woods at Quicks and I, and I followed him because sometimes the tide and the cans coming up through to New Bedford, it gets narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower.
So it's easier to have a heading.
Your riggers are up now too.
Huh.
Are your riggers up?
They've been up the whole time.
I came from Nantucket all the way through.
With the riggers up?
Yeah.
When did he get alongside you?
Put a line on you?
Inside the barrier.
Inside, okay.
I told him, I told him I called him on the radio, I said Charlie I think the best and easiest way to do this is for me to get this boat all the way through the barrier as soon as I get, you know, 20 feet into the barrier and I see the opening of space.
I'm running down there I'm knocking her gonna out of gear.
See me come close to a halt, come alongside of me.
Right.
And hook up to me, and then you park.
And take you into the shipyard.
Snd he was like.
And he put you in the traveller's slip.
Right in the traveler.
They said that we had this whole Monday.
And nobody, just to confirm, except for the minor burn on your leg, nobody get hurt?
Nobody.
You're OK?
Levi?
Yup.
Yup.
And who helped you fight the fire?
Pretty much everybody or who had the?
Everybody played, everybody played their part.
Everybody played their part.
I mean, a lot of guys were, you know, tied up and just, you know.
You went and grabbed around all the extinguishers on the boat, and brought them down.
Because I see there's a couple sitting there.
Levi, his brother, mainly me, Levi, and his brother.
I heard John call, running out fire, fire, fire.
John, John found it.
John.
I ran right down.
Who was on the wheel when it happened?
Grabbed an extinguisher.
I was up there an hour.
You were on the wheel.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Very good.
You understand I tape recorded this, and I had your permission?
Yes.
