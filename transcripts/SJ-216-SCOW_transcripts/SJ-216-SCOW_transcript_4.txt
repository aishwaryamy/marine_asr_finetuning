And we're going to add in Liz for 216, sorry, that when we're talking about the condition for the cargo box, we're just going to, add in that, in areas where the transverse frames of the base of the box are standing most proud, there is white sand debris sitting in them and frozen.
The aft portion of the cargo box has a substantial amount of new plate as well as the forward portion.
The quarter number two and three of the cargo box are older plate with only small repairs throughout.
