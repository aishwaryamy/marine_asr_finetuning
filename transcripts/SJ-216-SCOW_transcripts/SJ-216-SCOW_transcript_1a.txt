I'll now go into a brief description.
Then I'm going to go into the starboard side shell external condition and the bow area, as well as the stern area, stern show, or stern rake I guess, and then I'll get back up on deck, I'll walk the deck, I'll finish the description, and then we'll do the port side, side shell, and then the, then I'll do the deck, the inside of the box, and then I'll jump the tanks.
Alright here we go.
The Barge SJ216 is a 260 foot steel constructed scow, with a raked head and a flat stern and flat sides.
Forgot how to word that Liz, we'll just take from context.
And radius head log as well as radius deck log, or, as well as deck radius, or radius deck edge, yeah, radius deck edge.
The barge is designed for carrying sand, salt and dust related product.
Now Liz I'll add in a count on the tank layout as well as the cleats after.
So I'll get back to that for vessel description.
Okay, starboard side condition.
Well, I guess for the vessel description, let me add something in for the sides.
The sides are fitted with several small welded rough pads in close proximity to the deck edge, where the cleats are laid out on each side.
As well as another rub pad at, or just below, the waterline in the same proximity to the cleats.
Okay, going now to starboard external condition.
Starboard side shell external condition.
The side shell is heavily battered running the length of the side with longitudinal frame standing proud throughout.
The deck radius has, is heavily battered with a majority of the deck radius set in and upended at various locations or creased.
Coatings are near, are 80% with the remaining area being worn off coatings with rust forming.
Transverse frames running from the deck, deck edge to the bottom are standing proud at each cleat location, as well as several other locations between the cleats.
Okay, we'll do bow condition.
We'll do head rake.
The rake, head rake is lightly battered throughout, with longitudinal frames and transverse frames standing proud.
The rake radiuses are heavily battered from the waterline to the deck edge, or to the head log, not the deck edge.
Head log is moderately battered, let's just make the bow also moderately battered.
The head log is moderately battered, running the length of the head log with a transverse frame standing proud.
Coatings are over 80% with the remaining areas having light rust forming.
And then going back to starboard side shell condition that we were just talking about.
Starboard side shell, heaviest battering is in close proximity to the midship area, where a larger fendering had previously been placed.
Going back to, so now we're talk, we're in the bow condition area.
For the head log, we talked about how it was moderately battered throughout.
We can just add in the most significant indentations are heavy batterings on the corners, as well as in areas in close proximity to the two fins that are approximately three feet inboard of the rake radius.
And then when we go into the vessel description, let's just add that on the bow there are two fins extending from the head log onto the rake, approximately three feet down and inboard, constructed of steel plate with no internal framing to them.
Okay, continuing on with external conditions.
Adding to the starboard external conditions.
In an area starting from the stern and six feet forward, below the aft corner bitts, from the water line to the deck radius is heavily stove in, with the longitudinal frames impacted as well.
There is a significant rust forming at the first transverse frame just aft of the draft numbers, where heavy set ins along the longitudinal frames continue forward to the remaining moderate battering on the side of the hull.
Ok, stern condition.
The stern condition has coatings over 90%, with the remaining being light rust forming where paint has been scraped off.
The entire stern is flat, with ground weldments running from centerline outboard, approximately three feet each side, just below the deck edge.
The stern log is, or stern rake, is, because it's all flat, so I guess the stern rake, is moderately battered with several heavy indentations from the deck radius down approximately six feet.
The remaining deck radius from the stern rake is, or the deck radius from the stern rake is moderately battered running the length of the hull.
Okay, now for the star, or port side shell here, now port side shell.
So we'll do everything we put in for the starboard side shell, let's just put that in for the port side shell.
Let's also put that at the midship area of the barge, the deck radius is heavily set up on either side of the number four kevel cleat, where the deck of the barge is raised heavily at an angle.
And then, let's also add that in close proximity to the head log and the stern log, the side shell is heavily set up, from the waterline up to the deck edge.
And then for the port side shell, we're also going to put a, like, a note saying that it was viewed from the barge that it was breasted to.
At the time of the survey, the barge was breasted starboard side to the dock.
I guess we can put this in scope of survey.
Scope of survey, at the time of the survey, the barge was breasted starboard side to the dock, and the cargo box was being swept clean with light machinery.
Ok, Liz, adding on to general description.
For when we talk about the bow, we can say, you know, I think we said there was a raked bow.
We can also say that the deck is inclined forward, to a point ending at the forward end of the cargo box.
Also for the particulars, yeah for the particulars let's add in this for the build.
Let's put a, so we already put the location, but it's built by Jeff Boat.
The year was 1984, and then the hull is numbers 832-601.
Okay, deck description.
The deck is painted blue with the externals of the cargo box painted blue as well.
The barge is fitted with a large cargo box that is surrounded by a 42 inch high bulwark with stanchions every four feet, and a 18 inch top rail with the edge highlighted in yellow.
On the forward corners of the cargo box bulwark, there are running lights installed, or running, instead of running lights lets put running light, running lights holders installed, with no running lights.
There is an additional stern light holder on the centerline aft face of the bulwarks.
The cargo box, continuing on with the cargo box, the cargo box is deep and goes goes all the way to the bottom of the barge, with primarily transverse framing.
The sides of the cargo box are heavily patched and rusted with a longitudinal frame, primarily longitudinal frames.
Okay, going back to general description, the barge is laid out with 12 watertight spaces, including a bow tank, a bow rake tank, stern rake tank, and five starboard mid-body tanks and five port mid-body tanks.
The barge is fitted with four double barrel bitts that are connected at the bottom and at the mid-body.
The bitts are fitted on each corner of the barge.
On the inboard side of each bitt is a large and small button fairlead with the small button on the forward end.
Each button is fitted on a doubler plate.
And then for the, let's put in that the large is, we'll put like large 18 inch button, and then the small, we'll make it like 9 inch.
And they're both, and for the doubler plate, the large one is on a 24 by 18 doubler, the small is on a 18 by 12 doubler.
And then let's also put that the bitts are on doublers as well.
On the centerline of the bow, there are three 30-inch kevel cleats on doubler plates, with one on the centerline bow and two orientated longitudinally, approximately five feet outboard of centerline.
Aft of the longitudinal cleats are staples, two staples, one, each one approximately five feet aft, or four feet aft of the the longitudinal cleats.
The staples are mounted on 12 by 24 inch doublers, and smaller 12 by 4 inch doublers.
Between the staples and the corner bitts, there are two towing padeyes mounted on doublers and orientated towards the center line.
Now let's go to deck condition.
For deck condition, we'll do the bow.
We'll just put that the deck condition for the bow is lightly dished, throughout with the corners of the deck radiuses, or instead of corners just the deck radiuses, heavily set in.
We'll also put that there are light indentations throughout the plate.
The coatings are over 90%, and maybe that they're blue.
Areas that are not coated are starting to form rust.
There are additional small doublers welded and coated over throughout the deck.
There is one uncoated doubler just inboard of the port number one cleat.
Okay, going back to the description.
Down the port and starboard sides of the cargo box, there is approximately four feet of deck leading to the deck radius.
The deck is fitted with twelve inch high raised 4-dog hatches, leading to the below deck voids.
There are approximately five hatches on the port side and five hatches on the starboard side.
Let's also add that there's a bow hatch of the same configuration when I was describing the bow, and a stern hatch of the same configuration when I described the stern.
Down the port and starboard side between the bow corner bitts and the stern corner bitts are approximately six 30 inch kevel cleats mounted on doublers spaced with approximately 25 to 30 feet between each one.
At the number three and number five kevel cleats, there are buttons, we'll put 18 inch large buttons welded within two feet of the cleats.
The number three cleat has the button aft and the number five cleat has the button forward.
And then describing the deck, the deck coatings are over 90%, with light rust forming throughout.
The deck is lightly set in along the entire length of the deck, with light rust forming on the bulwarks.
Between kevel cleat number two and three, the deck is heavily set up in close proximity to the deck radius.
Between kevel celat number three and four, the deck is heavily set up, in close proximity to the deck radius.
And that's on the port side, what I just described for the setups.
So let's just make that, the port and the starboard can be the same for description, but we're going to add in that setup discussion for the port side.
And then for the starboard side, we're going to add in that the starboard side between the forward end of the cargo box and the number two keval cleat, the deck is moderately set up in close proximity to the radius.
Same description about the coatings.
And then between the number three and number four kevel cleats, the deck is moderately set up at the midpoint.
Okay, and then we're going to describe the stern.
The stern is fitted with a 30 inch kevel cleat on a doubler at centerline.
There are two staples, one, each one approximately four feet outboard of the centerline kevel cleat on doublers, as previously described.
Aft and outboard of the staple, there are approximately two large 18 inch buttons mounted on doublers.
And then as we described, and then there's, on the center line, there is a 12 inch high raised hatch, raised 4-dog hatch, to access the stern rake.
Okay, so that, that was the description there for the stern.
Then we gave condition there for the sides, and the deck, and the bow deck.
And then for the stern deck, we'll just say that the stern has over 90% coatings, light set in, set downs throughout, with light rust forming.
And then we'll also put that the deck radius is moderately set up at several points along the stern deck radius.
And we'll also put that the, there are doublers welded along the deck radius running the full length of, full breadth, full breadth of the deck.
Okay now we're going to do condition of the cargo box.
The condition of the cargo box, so we'll just do the cargo box bottom has the transverse frame.
The cargo box is swept clean.
Coatings are less than 10% with the remaining being light rust forming throughout.
The bottom of the cargo box indicates several recent large plate repairs.
The remaining bottom plate has transverse frames standing proud throughout with limited coatings.
The stern of the, the stern face of the cargo box is lightly wavered throughout, with indent scattered throughout the face of the plate.
The port side of the cargo, plate, cargo box is lightly wavered throughout, with a longitudinal frame standing proud, and light to moderate indentations throughout at the forward end of the plate.
There are more moderate settings along the bottom edge of the plate.
The starboard side, we'll make the same description.
The forward end, there's more heavy set ins of the starboard side plate.
Okay, for the bow, we're gonna do the same description that we did for the stern, but we're gonna say that, along the bottom six feet, check that, eight feet of the bow plate, the, there are more moderate to heavy set ins running the length of the plate.
And then for the sides, we'll say there are several doublers, small doublers welded along the bottom eight feet of the plate.
Okay, Liz, and then just adding in for the box condition.
Let's just also put in that, I think I said that the frames were standing proud, let's put that the transverse frames are standing proud in the bottom with the bottom plate heavily dished throughout.
And then let's also, just, I think I said that there were doublers down the port and starboard side, let's also add that there are many recent plate repairs where spray paint was applied.
