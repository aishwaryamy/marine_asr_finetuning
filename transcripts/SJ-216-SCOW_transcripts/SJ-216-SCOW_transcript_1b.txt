Okay, internal conditions here.
Bow rake tank.
Quick summary, bow rake tank is a full breath tank, constructed of eight longitudinal bays, running up the rake to the head log.
Coatings are less than 20% with the remaining being light rust scale forming.
Coatings are primary, primarily intact, intact, on the trusses as well as the transverse frames and overhead deck plating.
Tank has approximately three inches of water at the base of the rake.
Okay, Bay 1 is going to be the port-most bay tank, and then we're going to work to starboard.
So we can do Bay 1, and we'll just put port in parentheses.
You know, let's also put that the bays are broken into three sections, with section 1 being the uppermost upper portion of the rake.
Sorry, let's, we'll say it's broken into four sections.
Section one being the uppermost rake and head log.
Section two being the next section.
Section three being the end of the rake.
And section four being the base of the rake and tank.
Okay, Bay 1, section 1.
Let's put head log plates 1 and 2 are heavily set in.
Transverse head log frame is moderately deformed running the length.
Rake plating 1 and rake plate 2 is moderately set up.
The radius of the bay is heavily, or moderately battered throughout.
The corner of the head log is moderately battered throughout.
Shell, the side shell longitudinal number one and side shell longitudinal number two are moderately deformed.

Yeah, cool.
And then now we're moving on to section four.
Section four, let's just put water, several inches of water in the base.
Aft bulkhead lightly wavered throughout.
The bracket number one is heavily rusted, and the deck longitudinal one is partially rusted away.
Okay, moving on to bay three.
Okay everything I just put for Bay 2 section 1, repeat that, but let's also, let's change that the rake longitudinal number one is heavily set up at the forward end, and rake plate number one is heavily set up on the forward end.
And the bracket number three, check that note, no reference to bracket.
And then let's put deck longitudinal number three is moderately set in to starboard.
Okay, moving on to section two.
Section two we can just repeat everything we just put for Bay 2 Section 2, except, no let's leave that as written, I will just repeat that.
Going back to what we put in for Bay 3 Section 3, the only thing we're not going to put, we're going to remove also the reference to a deformed truss, diagonal truss, we'll remove that for for Bay 3 section 1.
Okay, moving back to Bay 3 section 3.
Okay, let's make that the same as Bay 2 section 3.
And then Bay 3 section 4, we're gonna just put that the aft bulkhead, is lightly dished.
We're also going to put that bracket number one is moderately deformed, and bracket number four is moderately deformed on the aft bulkhead.
We're also, for bracket reference that we just made, let's just say upper bracket.
So upper bracket number one, moderately deformed, upper bracket number four, moderately deformed.
And then we're going to put lower bracket number one is no longer there, and or it rusted away.
And that'll cover it for Bay 3 section 4.
Okay, Bay 4 section 1.
We can repeat everything that we put in for Bay 3, Bay 3 section 1, except we're not going to have anything about heavy indentation.
And we're going to make sure that, and we're gonna add in that rake longitudinals number 3 and rake longitudinal number four are heavily set up on the forward end, and that rake palting number two and three are moderately set up.
No references to any deformed trusses or anything.
You know, I think we have, we're saying that the head log is moderately battered.
Okay, moving on to Bay 4, Section 2.
It's the same as Bay 3, Section 2, except we're going to put that deck longitudinal number 1 is moderately, sorry, we're going to put that deck longitudinal 1 through 3 is moderately deformed.
We're going to say that deck plating number 3 is moderately set in.
No references for any trusses.
Okay, Jesus.
Okay, Bay 4, Section 3.
It's the same as Bay 3, Section 3.
Same entries.
Heavy rust in the longitudinal rake, rake longitudinals, and we can just also put that the rake plating is heavily rusted on the bottom portion of this section, and let's add that in for section threes, for Bay 1 through 4.
Okay Bay 4 section 4.
Same as Bay 3 Section 4, except that the upper bracket number 1 is moderately deformed, and upper bracket number 2 is moderately deformed.
And lower bracket number 4 and 3 is lightly set in.
Everything else is the same, I think we've made reference that the longitudinal, the rake longitudinals are heavily rusted, let's just make sure that remains.
And you know deck longitudinals are lightly set in.
Okay Bay 5 section, section 1.
We're going to put head log is moderately battered, head log transverse frame is moderately deformed.
Deck longitudinal number one and, one through three is, are lightly set in.
Nothing for vertical stiffeners.
Rake longitudinals are lightly set in throughout.
Rake plating is lightly set in throughout.
And that covers it.
Moving on to section 2.
Section 2, rake longitudinals are lightly set in throughout.

Deck longitudinal number 3 is lightly deformed on the forward end.
Okay, Bay 5, section 3.
Section 3, rake longitudinals are heavily rusted and lightly set in.
Rake plating is lightly set in with heavy rust at the lower portion.
Deck longitudinal numbers one through three are lightly set in.
Deck plating number two and three is lightly set in.
Okay, Bay five section four.
Aft bulkhead is lightly dished throughout.
Significant amount of water and rust forming in the, significant amount, significant amount of rust forming in the lower three feet of the tank, or of the aft bulkhead, sorry aft bulkhead.
Let's also put that the rake longitudinal are heavily rusted and lightly set up.
Nothing for the brackets.
Deck plating we'll say, deck longitudinals number one and two are lightly set in, deck plating is lightly set in.
And actually let's make it deck longitudinals one through three.
And let's just go back for all section fours, let's just put the same entry, that there's like three inches of water in the base of the tank, and that there's heavy rust forming in the lower three feet of the tank.
Okay, moving on to Bay six, section one.
Same entry as Bay 5 section 1.
That sounds good.
We'll put the diagonal truss is moderately set in.
And everything else is the same.
Okay, so still in Bay 6. section, now section 2.
This is the same as section two for Bay five, same entry.
Okay.
Bay six, section three, same entry as section three for Bay five.
And then same entry for Bay 6 Section 4 as Bay 5 Section 4, except that the lower bracket number 4 is rusted away.
Okay, going to Bay 7.
Bay 7, Section 1, same as Bay 6 Section 1, but we're going to put that rake longitudinal number one and two are heavily set up on the forward end.
Rake plating one and two are heavily set up on the forward end.
Vertical stiffener number one, vertical head log stiffener number one is lightly, or moderately deformed on the lower portion.
Deck longitudinals one through three are lightly set in throughout.
Same thing for, in regards to what we put in for the rakes.
Moving on to Bay 7 section 2.
Same as Bay 6 section 2.
We'll put in that rake longitudinal number 2 is heavily rusted.
Okay, Bay 7, Section 3.
Same as Bay 6, Section 3.
Should have references to the rake longitudinals being heavily rusted, and that the transverse, the lower transverse frame is heavily rusted as well.
I think we've had that throughout, it's heavily rusted throughout.
And we can also put that there's holes in the transverse frame.
Okay Bay 7 section 4, we'll put aft bulkheads lightly dish throughout.
Rake longitudinals are heavily rusted.
Same quantity of water as before.
Rust forming on the lower three feet, heavy rust forming on the lower three feet.
