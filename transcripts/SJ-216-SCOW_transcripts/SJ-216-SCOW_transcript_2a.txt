All right, accidentally pressed a button so still port tank 3, bay 4.
We're gonna make bay 4 the same as bay 3.
And yeah the deck trains are the same.
the same.
Let's make Bay 5.
New definition for Bay 5.

Internal side shell we can make that the same as Bay four and five vertical stiffener upper portion is moderately distorted.
recent repair to the deck transverse frame with a new transverse frame and a new upper portion of the side shell vertical sifter.
Bay six.
Make bay six the same as bay five except deck frame is heavily distorted.
No new renewals like I was just discussing and everything else is the same.
Bay 7.
Bay 7 is the same as Bay 6.
Yep, with a heavy distortion on the deck frame.
Yep, that's all the same as Bay 6.
And then Liz, let's just put in the catch-all for this port tank 3.
Let's put the transverse frames at the base of the tank.

And let's also put the deck transverse frame is moderately distorted through the outer portion and let's also put that the deck long longitudinals are lightly set in.
Bay 2 make it the same as Bay 1 except the side shell on incident one will be moderately distorted.
Bay 3 make it the same as Bay 2 except the vertical Stiffener is only moderately distorted through the upper portion and or throughout the entire vertical stiffener side trail vertical stiffener.
Okay gonna slide over okay Bay 4 Bay 4 is the same as Bay 3 here.
Yeah the same as Bay 3.
Except that the deck frame is moderately distorted and the upper portion of the internal shell vertical is moderately set aft.
Okay, moving on to Bay 5.
Oh wait and one other thing for Bay 3, addition for Bay 3, diagonal, lower diagonal trust is moderately distorted.
Same thing for Bay 4.
Okay Bay 5, side shell is lightly distorted.

Side shell longitudinals 1 through 3 are moderately distorted.
4, 5 and 6 are lightly distorted.
Side shell vertical siphon 1 is lightly distorted.
Shell longitudinal one or internal side shell is lightly set in internal side shell longitudinal or lightly set in deck longitudinal one and two are lightly distorted deck plating is lightly set in throughout let's also put that on on Bay's 3, 4, and 5 as well.
That the deck plating is lightly set in.
And that the deck line longitudinals are lightly set in.
Bay 7.
Bay 7, we have a side shell is recently repaired and lightly set in.
Side shell longitudinal halls 1, 2, 3 are moderately set in for five and six are lightly set in internal side shell is the same as Bay six.

Internal shell brackets one and two are lightly disturbed.
Longitudinals one through three or Longitudinals are lightly set in.
Deck plating is lightly set in.
Internal side shell, internal shell is the same as Bay four.
Okay, Bay, tank 5 report.
Okay, port tank 5.
I believe same configuration 8-base.
Coatings are the same as tank 4 there.
Bay 1, side shell moderately set in.
Side shell longitudinal loans heavily set in on the forward ends.
Side shell brackets 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are heavily distorted.
Internal shell brackets 1, 2 are lightly distorted.
the internal shell is the way we set in.
Bay 2, side shell is the same as Bay 1, except for the brackets.
Bay 1, Bay 2 or Bay 3.
Side shell is lately set in.
Side shell on June 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are lately sorted.
Side shell on June 1, number 3 is moderately distorted.
Internal shell is the same as Bay 1 and 2.
Transverse deck frame is moderately set in.
And deck radius for the first three bays are lightly battered.
Bay four, side shell is lightly set in.
Side shell longitudinal one and three are moderately distorted.
side shell longitudinal two, four, five and six are lightly set in.
And then for all the bays we need to say the vertical stiffeners are lightly just ordered.
Internal side shell is the same as Bayes three.
And deck frame is the same as well.
covers bays one through four going to five here.
As we can also say that the base of bay four has substantial amount of rust and debris buildup and that we can also put that the bottom transverse frames for each bay are heavily rusted.
Okay moving on to bay five, the the same as bay four.
Moving on to bay six.
Bay six, side shell longitudinal six is moderately distorted.
Side shell longitudinal number one for bay six is moderately distorted.
Deck radius is moderately battered.
We're going to put that for all the base.
Side shell longitudinal 3, 4 is lightly set in internal side shell is the same as previous Bay 5.
DAC transverse frame is moderately distorted.
Vertical stiffeners are widely distorted except for side shell vertical stiffeners moderately just sorted through the hour.
Yeah, it's route.
Okay, Bay 7.
They seven make Bay 7 the same as Bay 6 except that the side shell longitudinal number one is just lightly setting.
Okay, and yeah, yeah, yeah, no that's fun.
And also that the deck transverse frame is heavily distorted towards the side shell.
Okay, going to Bay 8, Bay 8 side shell on longitudinals are moderately distorted throughout side shell plating is lightly set in.
side shell brackets are rusted away and distorted throughout internal shell brackets.
Number three is a medium moderately distorted.
Internal side shell is the same as Bay 7 deck.
Yeah decks are about the same.
We'll just put in for each one of these bases.
The deck is the way we set it.
I think I already said it, but let's just put that the base of the base are full of rust and debris.
Okay actually going to bay 3 at the turn of the cargo box there is a one-inch puncture in the cargo box.
Hey was just going to do the external condition on the deck let's put on the port corner of the cargo box, bulwarks there is a GPS antenna screwed into the boards with a active status light and solar power array.
Okay, stern log tank or stern rake tank broken up into bay 8 base with transverse or longitudinal trusses and mid body or mid tank longitudinal stiffeners joining the vertical stiffeners.
So what am I trying to say?
So eight bays.
Lower three feet of the bay is moderate rust forming.
Coatings are over 70% with galvanized coatings remaining intact.
Approximately two inches of water in the base and water and muck at the base of the tanks.
And there are, what I was trying to say is there are mid tank the stiffeners, adjoining the head log and the forward bay.
And running longitude and we.
So I'll just go left to right bay one.
side shell is moderately set in throughout.
Side shell longitudinal longitudinals are heavily deformed.
Deck radius is moderately battered.
Stern log is lightly set in throughout with transverse frames, lightly set in throughout.
and deck plating and deck longitudinals lately set in, rush forming at the deck to stern log abutments.
Bay two, Bay two, transverse side shell or stern log transverse frame.
frame.
One is moderately set in.
And plating is moderately set in throughout the transverse frame.
One.
All other transverse frames are lightly set in.
Vertical stiffeners are lightly set in throughout the and deck log or deck longitudinal was our white we said in deck plating is lightly set in Bay 3 same thing as Bay 2 Bay 4 same thing as Bay 3 except well for bay 3 and bay 4 we're going to add in that the transverse frame number 2 is also moderately set in.
And we'll do the same for 5 and then for 6 we'll put that the vertical stiffeners 1 is heavily rotted away throughout the upper portion.
And vertical Stiffener number two is heavily rested away throughout the, or moderately rested away throughout the upper portion.
We'll also put that the deck longitudinals one and two are heavily rotted away throughout the half portion of the longitudinal.
Everything else will remain the same.
and we'll put that the mid-tank stiffeners 1 and 2 are moderately distorted.
Then base 7 we'll put that there are newer mid-body mid-tank stiffeners that have been welded a three new mid-tank stiffener has been welded and a new diagonal truss upper diagonal truss everything else will be the same and then bay seven will make it the same as bay three and then bay eight the hang on I got to shift around here for Bay 7.
Yeah no Bay 7 is good there and then Bay 8 we're gonna do a side shell longitudinal set in.
Side shell longitudinal three and four are moderately set in.
Side shell longitudinal one and two are lightly set in and upper plate areas lightly set in and transverse frames and transverse stern log.
That's how I should have been referring to transverse stern logs that are lightly set in.
And then for each bay we can also just put that the forward bulkhead side shell or forward bulkhead shell is lightly set in.
And that the bulkhead stiffeners are lightly set in throughout the lower portion.
We'll put that for every day.
Additional at bay 7 and 6 transverse stern log frame number 2 is heavily set in and surrounding plate area is heavily set in.
And that covers it.
We can also add for Bay 7, the Stern Log stiffner 1 and 2 are heavily rotted away.
Upper portions are heavily rotted away.
where they adjoined the deck longitudinals are heavily wasted.
Ok now going to starboard number 5.
