Hey Liz, one more thing for that 216.
We can add in that the barge has labeling on the forward and aft, the forward bulwark and the aft bulwark.
We can also, we'll put that in the description, and that rust is bleeding on all sides of the bulwarks.
We can also add that starboard tank number one, that the ladder, we can put that in the external, or the internal conditions for starboard tank 1.
Let's just put that the ladders heavily rusted and likely won't last much longer.
Also we're going to put that there's steel cables hung on the number one starboard kevel cleat, and the number six, six kevel cleat, with large truck tire hung down to the rub rail on the fore and aft ends.
I guess what means fore, we don't need to put fore and aft ends.
