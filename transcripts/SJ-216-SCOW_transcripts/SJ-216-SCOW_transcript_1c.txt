Rake longitudinal, number 1 and 2 are, let's just make Section 2 the same as Section 3.
Yeah, let's make that the same as Section 3.
Two and three are the same, yeah.
And then we're going to add that for sections one, we're going to put that the vertical stiffener is moderately deformed, and the upper transverse frame is lightly deformed.
We're going to put for section two that the upper transverse frame is lightly deformed throughout.
We're going to put that vertical side shell stiffener is moderately deformed throughout.
For bay 3, or, for section 3, bay 8, we're going to put that the vertical stiffener, or vertical side shell stiffener is heavily deformed on the upper portion and moderately deformed through, through the lower portion.
And we'll put that the vertical, or the upper transverse frame is moderately deformed in close proximity to the side shell.
And then the lower transverse frame is heavily rusted, with heavy rust forming on the base of the rake.
Okay, Bay 8, Section 4.
Base of the tank is, or base of the section is heavily mucked with three inches of water at the base.

Okay, Bay 2.
Let's make Bay 2 the same as Bay 1, except no reference to brackets.
And the vertical, or the side shell longitudinals 5 and 6 are not heavily battered, they're just moderately, like the rest of them.
And vertical stiffener number two is lightly deformed throughout.
And then just, Liz, going back to the top for port tank number one, we can just put that the underside of the cargo box could not be sighted due to the orientation of the bay.
Okay, Bay 3.
Let's make Bay 3 the following.
Side shell is lightly dished throughout.
Side side shell longitudinal one is lightly deformed.
And actually let's make that one.
Check that, let's make that two.
And well, for lightly, so, start over.
Bay three.
Side shell plating is lightly dished throughout.
Side shell longitudinals 1 and 4 are lightly set in.
Side shell longitudinals number 2 and 3 are lightly, or moderately set in.
Internal shell, that's the same as described in Bay 1 and 2.
Vertical stiffener is the same three is the same as vertical stiffener number one, or, sorry, number two.
And when I was referring to the vertical stiffener, that is the internal vertical stiffeners one and two.
So now I'm in Bay three, so it's vertical stiffener number three is lightly deformed throughout.
Side shell vertical stiffener is lightly deformed through the upper portion.
Okay and just going back to Bay 2.
Bay 2 let's just put deck longitudinals are lightly set in, deck plating is lightly set in.
Same thing for Bay 3.
Okay Bay 4.
Same as Bay 3 but let's put that the side shell brackets, side shell brackets 1, 2, 3 are heavily rusted and deformed.
Side shell bracket 4 is lightly deformed.
Let's make that four and five.
Internal shell bracket one is no longer present.
Two and three are heavily, or two is heavily broken away and rusted.
And then three, four, and five is heavily or moderately set in.
And just going back for Bay 4 here, the side shell longitudinals one and two are moderately set in.
Side shell longitudinal three and four are heavily set in, and deck plating is heavily set in.
Alright, that's it for port tank one.
Okay, port tank number two.
Port tank number two.
Composed of 8 bays.
Coatings are around 50% with the remaining coatings being galvanized coating.
Approximately three to four inches of water and sand at the base of the bays.
Heavy rust forming at the lower 2 feet of the bays.
Okay, Bay 1.
Side shell longitudinal moderately set in throughout.
Side shell, sorry that was plating, side shell longitudinals 1, 2, and 3 are moderately set in, side shell longitudinal 4 and 5 are lightly set in.
Side shell brackets 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are moderately set up.
Let's change that., let's remove 3 from that list.

Okay so Bay 7.
Bay 7 is the same as Bay 4, yeah so make it the same as Bay 4.
Yep, that'll be fine, that looks exactly the same, same description.
Bay 8.
Bay 8 is the same as Bay 6 except we're gonna put that the side shell brackets one, three, or one, four, and five are heavily distorted.
And we're going to put that the deck radius, or the number one side shell longitudinal is heavily distorted, the deck radius is heavily battered and we'll put that the, for bay seven, sorry, going back to bay seven, the vertical side shell stiffener is heavily distorted throughout the upper proportion.
