Okay, so this is the recording for the SJ211.
This is, it's Wednesday, January 15th, 2025.
So the barge description will be the exact same as the 216.
So everything can go over, all the particulars can go over, scope of survey can go over, except this time the barge is portside to the dock, with a barge breasted on its outside, on its starboard side.
And I have the official number here.
So the official number for the SJ211 is 665832.
The gross register tonnage is all the same.
The place built is the same, ownership is the same, and year completed is the same.
When I'm up on the deck, I'll give you the, they have like a builder number that I'll throw in there too that we can put in for the build date.
And when I'm up on the deck, if there's any slight differences with the deck layout, I think there might be a cleat missin, I'll, I'll let you know.
Otherwise we'll just keep it all the same there.
So now we'll do exterior conditions.
I'm looking at the bow right now, so I'll start with the bow, but you can just copy and paste it all over from 216 and make some slight updates.
As I said in the last recording, the bow rake is lightly indented throughout with light dishing along the longitudinal framing.
Coatings are over 90%.
Actually, let's make it over 95%.
Now we'll do the head log.
Head log is moderately indented throughout with the deck radius stood up at several points.
The heaviest or the deepest indentations are in close proximity to the, I think yesterday I called them like bow triangles or something, but they're push knees or bow knees, I guess, yeah, bow knees.
So the heaviest indentations are inboard of the bow knees.
Then we'll do the port rake corner.
The port rake corner is moderately indented, with the upper portion heavily indented, with three heavy indentations starting just below the head log corner and running about halfway down to the waterline.
So that covers that.
Then we're going to put for the starboard rake corner, we're going to say it was sighted from overhead and I'll add in a reading for that was.
I'm just going to move on now to the port side because I can see that from the side.
And we'll go to the stern after the port side and we'll, then we'll do the starboard side and the starboard rake if there's any additions.
Okay, port side.
It looks exactly the same as the 216.
It's dished, or, dished along the framing with the frames standing proud.
And the deck radius is turned up at the beginning of the port, or that the beginning of the bulwark cargo box, to Kevel cleat number two.
Oh, we can also put in the scope of the survey that at the time of the survey the cargo box was being cleaned out.
So what I'm going to do there is I'm going to do the cargo box very last after I do all the tanks.
So you can just slide that in for the external conditions at the end.
Same configuration as the 216, we'll just try and get them to be almost duplicates except for the conditions of course.
Okay, and then we can also put between, between Kevel cleats 3 and 4, the deck radius is heavily set up and then it dips down, and then between Kevel cleats 4 and 5 the deck radius is heavily set up running the length between the two Kevel cleats.
And the side shell between Kevel cleats 3 and 4, or, 4 and 5 and 3 and 4 is moderately set in along the frames and the upper framing.
They are, it is moderately set in.
I think we already kind of gave the definition so the first part I said with the side being moderately set in, it's really only the upper portion.
So I'll just leave that entry about the upper portion being moderately set.
Okay, then between 5 and 6, deck radius is lightly set up and the upper portion of the sideshell is moderately set up.
And then everything else is the same as I wrote for the, as like a catch all there, where I said that the frames are standing proud, shell is set in.
Okay, going to the stern rake.
Okay, for the stern rake condition, just inboard of the radius corners, the stern rake, I guess stern log is heavily set in approximately, for approximately 3 feet on the port side.
On the starboard side there's a similar heavy set in, ending just above the waterline.
Coatings are over 90%, with coatings rusted away at the center line just below the deck radius where several ground weldments are present.
And we'll also put in along the, the, the entire side of her, I don't know, it's, hang on.
The stern is heavily...
The stern log plating is lightly dished along the vertical and transverse framing, especially starting below 6 feet from the deck radius down to the waterline.
And then we're going to put up the deck radius is heavily set up, on both the port and starboard corners, and lightly set up along the rest of the stern log.
And then just going back to the port side shell.
The port side shell let's just put an entry that in close proximity to the aft draft marks, there's coatings that are heavily worn away at the deck radius down approximately four feet, and aft of the draft marks, we'll also put that the side shell is heavily set in from the, or moderately set in from the deck radius down to the water line.
And we'll also add that at the corners both port and starboard side, coatings are heavily worn away with rust form forming.
Aft corners, I guess, so that can be put under the stern log entry.
But yeah it's pretty similar to the other ones, so.
Okay, going up to the deck.
Okay Liz so there's no hull number here on the the stamp from the Jeff boat people, so we'll just leave that hull number blank there.
Like we we had one for the 216 but not for this one.
And then in the description, or in the bow area for both bow condition area for both this one and the 216, so I need to go back to 216, and just add that there are between 10 and 15 doublers welded just aft of the deck radius.
All doublers are between 8 by 8, and 3 by 3.
For vessel description for the Kevel cleats that we talked about on the bow area for this one, which, you know we're on 211 here.
We have to remove from the vessel description, or, and the bow condition, the starboard cleat that was orientated longitudinally just outboard of centerline.
So on the 211, there's only a port Kevel cleat mounted to a doubler oriented longitudinally.
And, you know, for all these entries, they're all on doubler plates, which I think I provided earlier, but just want to remind that.
And got it.
That'll be good.
Everything else for as far as the condition goes for the bow area, it's the same as the, as the 216 so you can copy and paste that in, and you can also add in for both the 211 and 216, I think I have it entered but, that the deck radius forward of the bulwarks all the way to the forward bitts on both port and starboard side is moderately set up.
Everything else is the same, coatings, all that, that's fine for the description and the bow condition.
Alright, I'm going to go down the port side and I'll give you a port side condition, but it's about the same as the 216 so you can copy and paste that as well.
We can put up that the deck radius is set up between Kevel cleats 1 and 2, in close proximity to port tank hatch 1.
And then that the deck radius is lighlty, light to moderately set up between Kevel cleats two and three.
And then the deck radius is moderately to heavily set up between Kevel cleats 3 and four with several heavy set-ins.
And then between Kevel cleat four, four and five, the deck is heavily, or the deck radius and the deck is heavily set up in close proximity to the deck radius with several heavy indentations.
I guess I mean set ins, yeah not indentation, set ins, with the heaviest set ins at the midpoint between the two cleats.
Okay, and then between Kevel cleat 5 and 6, deck radius is moderately set up.
And, you know, we can just put in a catch all, I don't know what I did for the 2-11, but you know that the deck has a white set ins along the port side there.
And then we can put another entry, just forward of Kevel cleat number six, there's a, the deck is lightly, or heavily set up, or set in.
Yeah, deck radius is heavily set in in close proximity to Kevel cleat number six.
And then for vessel description, we have to go back there.
The port number five, Kevel cleat on the 216 we had buttons.
We had a button forward to that.
There's no button in close proximity.
There's no button for Kevel cleat number five.
There's only a button aft of Kevel cleat number two.
So you know in the copy and paste there let's clear that up thanks.
Okay the stern for the description and the condition looks about the same the only thing I want to add in for the for this and for the 211 that I, or for the 216 that I missed, is that there are approximately six feet from the corner bitts,  there are two 36 inch by 30 inch doubler plates with six, and, three inch diameter indentations on each.
Also for vessel description, the buttons that are close to the staples are both large and they're orientated alongside each other instead of offset like the 216.
On the 216 we had previously noted that there was a, there were staples on doubler plates on each side of the centerline Kevel cleat.
The starboard, so we're only gonna, there's only, yeah, so the stern area.
The port staple that's still there just like on the 216, but there's no starboard staple just the doubler plate.
So if you could rewrite that, that would be great.
And yeah the stern on the 216 had two buttons like I was talking about that were offset around the staple.
They're both large, the 211, which is what we're on right now.
The buttons are on their own doubler plates, just like the 216, but they're not offset.
They're side by side and approximately three feet off the center line.
and two feet aft of the deck radius.
For condition, going back to stern condition, the port staple is lighly set aft.
Everything else is about the same as the stern on the 216.
And there's a heavy burn in close proximity to the bulwark on the centerline of the deck paint.
At the time of the survey they're still cleaning the barge but there is a ladder pump and large quantities of sand piled up on the starboard corner of the stern bulwark.
Okay Liz now we're doing starboard side from the bow area here.
So, you know, we can just say that the deck radius is lightly set in otherwise, unless otherwise noted.
Deck plating is lightly set in unless otherwise noted.
The deck between Kevel cleat 1 and 2, deck radius has several moderate set-ins in close proximity of Kevel cleat number two.
Entire deck is, at the time of the survey, is lightly covered with sand dusting that is being scooped and worked.
Deck radius between Kevel cleat number two and three is moderately set up on the forward end, with several light set ins within eight feet of Kevel cleat number three.
You know, paint coatings are about the same as 216, over 80%.
Light rust forming at the midpoint.
Between Kevel cleat number three and four, there are, the deck radius is moderately set up in close proximity to Kevel cleat three and lightly set in in close, set up in close proximity to number four.
There is a heavy set in in close proximity within three feet of, or, three feet forward of Kevel cleat number four, with the affected area being approximately two feet.
In close proximity, at the midpoint between Kevel cleat number four and five, the deck is moderately set up.
The remaining deck, or, deck, deck is moderately set up, deck radius, and the remaining space close proximity to 4 and 5 is lightly set up.
Deck radius between Kevel cleats 6 and 5 is lightly set up, with a moderate set in in close proximity, or set up in close proximity to 5, and a heavy set up three feet forward of Kevel cleat number six.
Otherwise coatings are as written.
There's light set ins throughout the deck area and several small doubler inserts that have been ground and not coated.
That will cover for the exterior.
