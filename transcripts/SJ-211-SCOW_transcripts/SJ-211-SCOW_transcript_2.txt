Okay, Liz, I was starting on the bow and then going down the port side.
Alright, bow rake, same configuration as SJ-216.
I'll just start with the port, bay one, section one, and then go all the way to bay eight, section four.
If we can just try I'm going to try my best to use the same language, but we'll try and keep it consistent between the two.
Bay one, Section one.

Section three.
side shell longitudinals one through three are, or one, one and 2 are moderately set in, three and four are lightly set in.
five, er, okay, and then side shell plating is lightly set in.
And then for those last four sections, I'll remember the, we'll just put deck radius is light to moderately battered.
Moving on to a side shell longitudinal diagonal is moderately deformed throughout.
And then rake longitudinals are lightly set in.
Rake plating is lightly set in.
side shell vertical stiffener is moderately set in on the upper portion.
And put that in as well for sections one and two.
Same thing with deck longitudinals, lightly set in.
Okay, moving on to section, oh, and for section three, let's just put that there's debris at the base of the rakes.
And we're also gonna put that rake radius bracket number one is moderately deformed.
And going back to section one, we're also gonna put that rake radius bracket number two is lightly deformed.
Okay, going on to section four.
side shell longitudinals one and two are moderately set in.
side shell longitudinals three and four are, or three is lightly set in.
We'll put four back in with the moderate set-ins, and then five and six are lightly set in.

Okay, going on to Bay three.
So Bay three, section one is the same as Bay 2 section one, except the diagonal is not deformed at the midpoint.
Bay three section 2 is the same as Bay 2 section two.
Yep that's fine.
And the transverse frame is yeah it's still lightly set in, yep.
Okay, yep.
And then Bay three section three we're gonna add into this one this is same as Bay 2 section three except the there's a heavy rust scale forming in the lower portion of the bay.
Bay three, Section four is the same as Bay two, Section four, except that the diagonal truss is not freed, so we can remove that entry.
And we're going to say that lower vertical stiffener bracket is, number 2 is moderately deformed and rusted.
Everything else is the same, you know, water, rust, diagonals, or uh, deck longitudinals, et cetera.
That's all the same.
Okay Bay four section one.
Bay four section one is the same as Bay three section one, it's got all that same.
That diagonal looks good.
We'll put that the uh deck plating between deck longitudinal 2 and three is set up on the forward end, moderately set up at the forward end.
Okay moving on to section two, Bay four.
That's the same as the other section or Bay three section two.
Bay four section three is the same as Bay three section three.
And then Bay four, section four, that's the same as Bay three, section four.
You know, the aft bulkhead throughout these sections is lightly wavered.
There's, you know, water and rust.
The rake longitudinals are heavily rusted.
The ladder is in this base, or section, so we're going to add that in.

Okay, moving on to Bay five section one.
Same as Bay four section, or Bay three section one.
Yeah, all that's the same.
Yep.
Bay five, section two, same as Bay three, section two.
Looks pretty good.
We can actually, for the verbiage that we're using for the rake longitudinal for Bay three through Bay five, we can actually remove that the rake longitudinal are set in and just say, and just leave that there are light set ins on the the rake plating.
Yeah that'll be good.
So we'll do that for Bay three through five, sections two, yeah sections two and section, or and Bay four sections one and two, we're also going to remove a reference to the rake longitudinals being lightly set in.
We're just gonna remove that and just have the plates having light set ins.
Okay moving on to Bay five section three.
That, this looks the same as Bay four, Section three.
Yep.
And then Bay four, or Bay five, section four, continuing on.
The lower, the low, the bottom rake brackets are heavily rusted and are lightly deformed.

Brackets are fine just heavily rusted so we can just put something about, we�ll just put the entry for that, the brackets heavily rusted, you know heavy rest of the base of the rake.
Okay moving on to Bay seven.
Bay seven we're going to do the same as Bay five section one except we're going to put that rake longitudinal one and 2 are moderately set up on the upper end and that the deck plating, or the rake plating is moderately set up on the upper end, and lightly set, or moderately set in on the upper portion and lightly set it on the lower portion.
We're also going to put that the forward ends of the deck longitudinals one and two are lightly deformed.

Same entry as Bay six section one.
Okay, Bay seven Section three.
This is the same as Bay six Section one.
So I'm in Bay seven Section three, and this is the same entry as Bay six Section three.
We just duplicate that.
Okay, and then Bay seven Section four.
Same etnry as Bay five section four.
There's no, there's just light wavering.
And we're gonna add in that the vertical stiffener number three is heavily rusted and the plating in its vicinity is heavily rusted as well.

Yes, I forgot what I used on the port side, but it was like rake, longitudinal, rake, or like side shell diagonal, I guess, is what I mean.
Yeah side shell diagonal.
So those are all moderately deformed for each section.
Then we're going to put the vertical stiffener as moderately deformed at adjoining points to the side shell longitudinals.

And, you know rust, and debris at the base.
Then we can also add in side shell brackets one, two, three, four, and five are moderately or heavily distorted.
There are light to moderate set ins along that bulkhead adjoining the brackets.
All right, that covers it for bow.
Oh, and you know we'll also put in section three for Bay eight, let's put that the deck transverse frame is lightly deformed.
And we'll also put that for section three as well, or section 2 as well.
Alright that covers it for the bow, thanks.

Some water at the base of the bay and debris.
Coatings appear to be in good condition.
Damage was sighted from the outside on the side shell and from the bay.
No fractures observed from far away.
Condition appears to be in good condition.
Okay, for port tank number two, let's just put a placeholder on that.
I had to put a pump in there to pump it dry.
Okay, Liz, port tank number three.
Eight bays.
Similar to how it was on SJ 216, so we can start there with port tank number three, and put it into this 21one.
I think I might have went overkill last time, so I'm gonna try and speed this up a little bit.
We're gonna put side shell longitudinals one through three moderate set in, four five six, light set in.

All of them are gonna have a lightly battered deck radius, except Bay three is gonna have a moderately battered set in on the forward end.
Everything else will be the same as Bay 2 there, no reference to forward bulkhead, deck longitudinals, deck plating, all the same there.
Now I'm going to try and, we're going to note, for the overall bay, we're going to note that there's approximately water just to, water up to the base of the bottom transverse frames.
And put that water, yeah, yeah, that's fine, and then coatings will put like 70%.
Lower portions of the bay could not be sighted, or lower portions of the tank could not be be sighted due to the water.
There's, all the bottom transverse frames are heavily rusted.
And that should work.
OK now Bay four, we're going to do the, make it the same as Bay three, except side shell longitudinals, only side shell longitudinal one is moderately set in.
Everything else is the same.
Okay, bay five.
Bay five.
Side shell longitudinals one and two lightly, one, two, four, and five are lightly set in.

Then bay eight, we're going to make bay eight the same as 7, except we're going to remove the reference to the deck transverse frame, and we're going to say that the side shell brackets are lightly set up, and the internal shell brackets are lightly set up as well.
That covers it for tank three.
Okay, port tank number four.
We're also gonna put the same entry that we put for port tank number one.
Several of the rungs are heavily rusted out, but we'll put rung three, four, and five.
Moving on port tank number five.
Okay, port tank number five.

Bay seven, make Bay seven the same as Bay six.
Bay eight.
Bay eight, we're gonna make Bay eight the same as Bay seven, except we're gonna remove reference to the transverse deck frame and the diagonals, and we're going to add that the side shell brackets one through five are, are heavily distorted, and nothing for the internal side brackets.
Yeah that's fine.
Okay everything else is the same there.
That's it for tank five.
Okay, stern rake.
Stern rake set up just like 216.
We're going to add in the, we're going, we're going to put the following here.

Side shell palting is moderately set in.
We're gonna put that the stern log plating is lightly set in otherwise noted.
We're going to put that the transverse head, transverse stern log frames are lightly set in, unless otherwise noted.
And we're gonna do the same for the head log stiffeners.
Then we're gonna put in that diagonal truss, upper diagonal trusses, one, two, one and two are moderately distorted at the midpoint.
And we're gonna put that, I forgot the term I used.
I think I used mid-tank head log stiffeners or mid tank head log transfer stiffeners.
Forgot how I worded it before.
We're going to use the same wording.
We're going to say that two, two through nine are light to moderately distorted.
And then we're going to also put that the upper portions of vertical, stern log verticals, vertifical stiffeners one, two, three, four, six and seven are moderately distorted on the upper portions.
We're also going to put for it that the bay is, you know, this is a catch-all for the bay, that the bay is lightly, or has water up to the bottom brackets at the base of the tank, and that there's heavy rust forming on the side shell.
The remaining has a relatively good galvanized or green paint coatings.
We're also gonna put that the deck log, or the deck plating is lightly set up throughout, and that the deck longitudinals are lightly set down and moderately deformed, where, at the adjoining vertical stiffeners, that were previously noted to be deformed.
Okay, going to the starboard side now.
See you know, Liz, yeah, no that's fine.
Yeah, I'm just going to keep the count going here.
Okay, then we're going to put the vertical stiffeners on the upper portion, of the vertical stiffeners eleven through fifteen are moderately distorted.
We're also going to put that the deck longitudinals between twelve and fifteen are moderately distorted on the ends adjoining the vertical stiffeners.
We're also going to put that diagonal truss five and six are lightly distorted at the midpoint.
We're also going to put that vertical stiffeners sixteen and seventeen are heavily rusted out over the upper portion, with minimal metal remaining intact, and that the vertical stiffener eighteen is heavily rusted as well, but without holes.
We're also going to put that the mid-tank trusses, or mid-tank trust stiffeners that I was talking about, seventeen through twenty are, or twenty-one, are moderately distorted in a way.
We're also going to put that deck plating, or head log plating at along the centerline is more, or is moderately set in.
Okay then, side shell to starboard now.
Side shell longitudinals one through four are heavily set up.
Side shell plating is moderately set in, and that should cover it.
Then deck plating is just lightly set up, as we previously discussed so that's okay.
For the stern log, let's also just put that at the base of all the vertical stiffeners on the head log and the forward bulkhead are heavily rusted.
Let's also make the same note about the bottom, base of the bottom.
Okay, starboard bay number five.
Starboard bay number five.
Tank five.
Okay Starboard tank number five.
Coating 70%.
A couple inches of water at the base of the tank.
Rust at the base of the entire tank.
Okay, yeah, starboard tank number five, Bay one.

Internal side, internal shell vertical stiffener, lightly distorted.
Side shell brackets one through five, moderate to heavily distortion.
Internal shell plating between, no, internal shell plating between, between, internal shell longitudinals two and three is as, as moderately set in, and actually let's make that two and four, so, there you go.
And mid body truss is moderately distorted at, or lightly distorted at the midpoint.
Okay, bay two.
Side shell longitudinal moderately, side shell longitudinals two and three, moderately distorted.
Side shell longitudinal one through six, are lightly set in.
Side shell plating between side shell longitudinals two and three is moderately set in.
Everything else is lightly set in.
Internal side shell is the same as bay one.
Deck overhead is same as Bay one.
The trusses are the same, with those distortions.
We're actually going to add, for only Bay one though, that the upper diagonalis has a light distortion.
And that covers it.
Bay three.
Bay three, we're gonna do a side shell, yeah, yeah, we're gonna do, Bay three, we're gonna do the same thing as Bay 2, except, yeah, no internal side shell is the same, yeah, that's all the same.
Okay, so Bay three, the same as Bay two there.
With the, only thing with Bay three is we're gonna make the side shell longitudinal number two lightly distorted, but side shell longitudinal number three can be moderately distorted.
Okay, and one, of course yeah.
And then, deck radius for all Bay, all those bays is lightly distorted.
You know also we're gonna put in a note in the beginning, that the, I think we already did, but the bottom transverse frames are heavily rusted.
Okay Bay four.
Bay four is the same as bay two, there.
So that's side shell longitudinals one through three are moderately distorted.
All the rest are light.
The same thing with the internal side shells.
Same thing with the trusses, same thing with the deck longitudinal, same thing with the deck transverse frame.
Vertical stiffeners are the same.

Internal all the remaining, so side shell longitudinals two through six, lightly set in.
Side shell longitudinal plating, or side shell plating, lightly set in.
Deck longitudinals, deck longitudinal two, lightly distorted.
Deck longitudinals one and three, lightly set in.
Deck plating, lightly set up.
Deck radius, lightly battered.
Internal shell is the same as Bay five.
Trusses are the same as Bay five, so no entry.
Bay six, sorry, Bay seven.
Bay seven, make Bay seven the same as Bay five.
And then Bay eight, except we're going to add in that the deck transverse frame is heavily or moderately distorted at the midpoint, and the deck plating is heavily rusted.
We're also going to put, heavy rust on the deck plating for five and six as well.
Okay, so that covers it.
Now, going to Bay eight.
Bay eight, we're going to make aft bulkhead heavily rusted throughout.
We're going to put that the side shell longitudinals one through four are moderately deformed.
Side shell, side shell brackets are all heavily set down.
Internal shell is the same as seven, no references to deck transverse frame or trusses.
And then side shell plating is light to moderately set in.
Okay, that covers it for Starboard tank five.
One more entry for Starboard tank number five.
For Bay one, there is a heavy crease between vertical stiffener number two and three.
And then, vertical stiffener three is moderately distorted.
And then that crease, or the, that's a heavy set in between vertical stiffener two and three on the forward bulkhead.
Got it.
Okay, starboard tank number four.
Particulars same as starboard tank number five.
Okay, side shell, side shells longitudinals one through three, moderately set in.
Four through six, lightly set in.
Side shell plating, lightly set in, with moderate set ins throughout.
Deck long, deck plating is lightly set up.

Side shell vertical stiffener is moderately distorted at the midpoint lightly, and, or at the mid to lower points, lightly disroted on the upper points.
Diagonal truss, lower diagonal truss one and midbody truss, lower diagonal truss and midbody trust is lightly distorted at the midpoint.
Internal side shell plating is lightly distorted with moderate set ins throughout.
And, Liz, let's put that in, in Starboard Tank number five, let's put in that reference where I put lightly set in with a moderate set-ins around, because that's the case.
I just was missing that verbiage in my brain.
So let's just throw that in for all the side shell platings, for all the, all the tanks.
Okay, internal side shell longitudinals one two and three are moderately, are lightly set up, and yep that covers that.
There's, you know, previously I talked about the water, so that's covered.
Okay, Bay 2.
Bay 2, oh wait, and then Bay one let's also put that the side shell brackets one, two, one through four are heavily just set down.
And, let's put internal show brackets one through four are moderately set down.
Okay, side shell longitudinals one through three, or one and two are moderately set up.
Three through six are lightly set in.
Side shell plating is lightly set in with moderate set ins throughout.
Deck transverse frame, that's lightly set up.
Side shell vertical stiffeners are, is moderately distorted throughout the bottom.
So that's, let's put everything about Bay one, except for the brackets, and the side shell discussion is the same.
And Bay three, let's do the same as well there.
And then at bay three, let's add in internal side shell.
Actually let's put it in for all the days.
For internal side shell, let's just put between the deck and the internal side shell longitudinal number one, there is heavy rust.
Bay four.
Bay four, let's make it the same as Bay three, but let's remove the references for the lower diagonals truss and the midbody truss.
Okay, Bay four, let's add back in the lower diagonal being, let's put in that the lower diagonal is moderately set in at the midpoint, and midbody truss is also moderately set in at the midpoint.
Also for, as we're now moving on, we're now moving on to Bay five.
Bay five, let's make it the same as Bay four, as we just added in that references to the diagonals in the midbody truss.
Same thing with the internal side shell, and we'll put in that the deck transverse framing is lightly distorted, and let's put that in bays three, four, and five there.
Okay, bay six.
We're gonna make it the same as bay five, but we're gonna make side shell longitudinal one heavily distorted, and we're gonna make the vertical stiffener, side shell vertical stiffener, heavily distorted on the upper portion, we're gonna make the deck radius moderately set in instead of lightly battered, and everything else is the same.
Okay, Bay seven.
We're gonna make Bay seven the same as Bay six, except, except side shell longitudinal one being heavily distorted, we'll make it moderately distorted, as well as number two.
The other ones we'll make, side shell longitudinals, we'll make them lightly set in.
The plate between side shell longitudinal, between the deck radius and side shell longitudinal number three, we'll put it moderately set in.
And we'll do the same for Bay six as well.
Okay, Bay seven.
We're going to make Bay seven the same as Bay six, but we're going to remove references to trusses, and verticals, and deck transverse frames, and we're going to add in that the side shell brackets are moderately set down, and the, no references for the internal shell brackets.
All right, that's it for starboard tank number four.
Okay, Liz, not sure if I already mentioned or not, but Bay one and two upper diagonals, let's put that there like we said in at the midpoints.
Moving on to starboard tank number three.
Okay, Liz, starboard tank number three.
Coatings, same as starboard tank number four.
Water is up to the base of the bottom transverse frames.
And I'll, eight bays, so I'll start with bay one here.
Side shell longitudinal one, three, and four moderately set in, side shell longitudinals two, three, and five, or two, three, and six, actually, you know, let's just make all the sideshell longitudinals heavily set in.
Also, let's make the side shell plating lightly set in, with moderate set ins throughout.
We'll do the same statement regarding the internal side shell, internal shells, and we'll also put that same thing for the internal shell longitudinals.
Deck plating, or deck radius, is light to moderate battering.
Deck longitudinals, lightly set down.
Deck plating, lightly set up.
Upper and lower diagonals, as well as midbody trusses, is, are moderately set aft.

Same thing with internal shell vertical.
And then we'll also put that there's heavy rust on the internal shell longitudinals.
And then we're also gonna put that side shell brackets are heavily set up and down.
And that the forward bulkhead is light, lightly set in, with heavy rest at the midpoint.
Okay, bay two.

But let's make the upper and lower diagonals moderately set aft, same thing with the midbody truss.
Everything else is the same.
Bay four.
Same as Bay three.
Yeah, everything is the same as Bay three.
Make sure, and then, let's add in rust in the overheads with the deck longitudinals, the deck plating, I mean.
The deck plating.
Let's also add for Bay four that the vertical stiffener is heavily rusted, side shell vertial stiffener is heavily rusted.
Bay five.
Bay five.
Let's make it the same as Bay four, except let's remove any reference to the upper diagonal being moderately set aft.
And otherwise it's the same.
Bay six, make it same as Bay five.
Heavy rust in the lower portion of the external, or the side shell vertical sifter.
Let's also put that in Bay five as well.
Okay moving on to Bay seven.
Bay seven.
Make Bay seven the same as Bay six, except side shell longitudinal, only side shell longitudinal one is moderately set in.
Let's make sure that the deck radius is just references lightly battered throughout.
Okay, moving on to Bay eight.

Let's make it the same as Bay seven, except let's remove any discussion of the deck transverse frame or the trusses or the diagonals.
Let's also add that the side shell brackets are lightly set down, and the internal shell brackets are heavily rusted.
Okay that covers it for the starboard tank number two.
And I think we already have it but you know the bay, the lower portions of the tanks are heavily rusted, the bottom transverse frames.
And I think, you know, just for starboard tank number two, I think we put in, but like, you know, all the, the vertical stiffeners in bay four and five and six are moderately deformed throughout.
Okay, Liz, just adding something in for Bay two for Starboard Tank Number two.
Let's make sure, let's add in that that side shell longitudinal number five is moderately set in, and that the side shell is moderately set in, in this entire area.
Okay, Liz, for starboard tank number one we're going to put that it wasn't entered.
Ladder rung number three, four, six, and seven, appear to be thinner than a pencil and heavily wasted away.
Okay and then sighted from overhead there is water at the base of the tank.
Coatings are less than 50%.
Alright, that'll cover for starboard tank number one.
Okay going back to port number two, got it pumped down.
Okay, port tank number two.
Port tank number two.
Coatings are around 50%.
Water is about halfway up the bottom frames.
Bilge pump for the area, a heavy high gauge bilge pump was pumping for the past two hours of the space, and water is not significantly falling.
