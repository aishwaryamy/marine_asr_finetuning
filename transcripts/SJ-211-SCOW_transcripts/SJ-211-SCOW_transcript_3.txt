 Hey!
Okay, Liz, sorry they slammed the bucket into, into the cargo box, seemed like the sky was falling, so I appreciate you, sorry about that, I'm going to put a note on the recording that the last 30 seconds there, be careful.
It gets real loud.
And we'll just for the other three bays just highlight them and put insert photos loud noise and I'll take it from there.
Okay, cargo box condition.
Cargo box condition's similar to SJ 211 except there's no large plate repairs.
The entire base of the cargo box is, plate is heavily set down, or moderately set down along the longitudinal frames, or transverse frames.
In the third quarter of the tank there is a frame space, or there is a bottom plate where the bottom plate is torn and set down.
At the time of the on hire they were in preparations to conduct a repair for a closer view.
The set down area is exactly in line with port Kevel cleat number 4.
Affected area is approximately two feet by twelve feet.
The port, starboard side of the cargo box is lightly set in along longitudinal frames with moderate set ins throughout.
We'll put the same thing for the port side.
Then for the stern side we're going to put in that the vertical frames are standing proud.
Moderate to heavy indentations are set in, are observed throughout the entire box with one set in, set ins along each frame, with the frame standing proud as I previously written.
You clean that up, Liz.
Back lower corner of the, or so on the port, corner of the aft side or aft face of the cargo box, there are several small damages that can be observed from the starboard side.
We'll also add in for the bottom of the cargo back so that the forward portion is, forward plate areas are heavily set down along the transverse frames.
For the port area, for the port corner area there's two small holes approximately two feet above the deck and eight feet inboard of the side.
We can also put for the port and starboard sides that the lower portions of the sides, or from the midpoint to the bottom of the sides, longitudinal frames stand the most proud with the plate the most set in.
Then, at the exact mid body of the bottom of the tank, it is a, there's a large area of heavy set downs.
And then there's one small crack approximately.
So we're going to edit that plate repair that needs to happen.
So there's a small tear in the bottom plate, approximately five frames forward of the large damaged area.
It is a couple, two feet outboard of centerline to port.
And then we're going to go back to the large damage where we were explaining how long it is.
So it's, the affected area is approximately two feet and that extends from just outboard of to starboard centerline, all the way to the port side of the side of the box, where a slight crack has formed up the side of the box approximately two feet.
Okay that's it for this SJ211.
