This is the on hire survey for the U1512 ABS spud barge located in Chesapeake, Virginia.
The U1512 has a steel deck barge, of all welded steel construction.
This barge is constructed so as to have a flat bottom with a transom type stern and raked bow with parallel straight sides and a flat deck.
Internally, the barge appears to be divided into 14 compartments, being port, starboard, and centerline forward rig tanks, four wing tanks down each side, and four mid-body compartments.
The equipment includes double barrel bitts at each fore and aft corner, three kevel cleats evenly spaced on the port and starboard sides.
The spudwells are found both fore and aft on the port and starboard side.
The port side spud wells both fore and aft do not have a deck coaming.
The aftmost spudwell on the port side has a steel plate covering the spudwell and welded to the doubler.
At the bow are towing padeyes, both port and starboard, and a centerline towing padeye that is pre-rigged with an emergency tow wire.
All padeyes are supported to the deck by doubler plate.
The deck is affixed with vertical pedestals for all navigation lights, port, starboard, and aft.
Down the port in starboard sides is an 8 inch rub rail full length.
There are no tires or other fendering on the bow or stern.
As a note, all kevel cleats are 36 inches.
And as another note, all double bitts and kevel cleats are supported by a doubler plate.
The head log was found to be an overall good condition with roughly 50% paint coatings and light to moderate scale full breath.
The port side was viewed from an adjacent barge.
The port side is protected by a single 8 inch rub rail full length.
The port side is in overall good condition with good paint coatings, light to moderate scale and light to moderate set ins of the rub rail full length.
There is a heavy set in to the rub rail on the port side just aft of the number 2 kevel cleat.
Area affected of the rub rail is approximately 6 inches.
There is a heavy set in on the port side, rub rail just outboard the number two port side tank area affected approximately six inches in diameter.
The starboard side was viewed from the deck.
Starboard side is protected by one eight inch round steel rub rail full length.
The side shell has good paint coatings approximately 50%.
The rub rail is slightly to moderately battered full length.
The stern was found to be in overall good condition with good paint coatings and light to moderate scale at each corner and centerline.
On the centerline of the stern there are two moderate set ins, approximately four inches in diameter right at the deck radius.
On the starboard side, inboard of the aftmost double bitts, there are two moderate set ins, approximately six inches in diameter at the deck radius.
In the same line and just below, approximately four feet below, there is another moderate set in, approximately four inches in diameter.
The deck was found to be in overall good condition.
The deck has good paint coatings.
Starting forward the deck has prior weldments that have been ground down flush to the deck.
Midbody the deck has past weldments that have been ground down to be flush with the deck.
Just inboard of the forward port side spudwell, there's a moderate set down, approximately two inches in diameter.
Between midbody tank two and three, there are weldments that have not been ground flush to the deck.
Approximately six weldments on center line that have not been grounded to the deck.
10 feet aft of midbody tank 3 hatch.
There is a moderate set down of the deck, approximately 6 inches in diameter.
On the stern just aft of the hatch for midbody tank 4, there are 4 prior weldments that have not been ground flush to the deck.
On the stern, just to port of centerline, is a Predator 9000 generator.
On the cover to the aftmost port spudwell is binders and chain.
The deck hatches were all found to be in good condition.
