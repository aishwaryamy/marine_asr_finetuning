Some important notes to make.
These spuds were not on the barge at the time of the survey, so we will have to check those out at some point.
I might have misspoke during the external conditions for the compartmentalization.
There is a forward, a centerline, and a starboard rake tank.
Then there are four wing tanks both to port and starboard and then four mid-body centerline tanks.
The number four tanks go all the way back.
It's the furthest, furthest aft tank to the side shell of the transom.
