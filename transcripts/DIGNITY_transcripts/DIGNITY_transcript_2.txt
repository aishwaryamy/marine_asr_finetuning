Liz, sorry about that, the battery died.
Description, the barge Dignity, actually just put these notes in and I'll fix it.
The barge Dignity has a two tier pipe railing surround, a two tier pipe cable surround protecting the edge of the deck.
At the bow are two chock [], two kevel cleats, with single barrel bitts on each corner.
The single barrel bitt to port is missing the ears, the single barrel bitt to starboard is missing the forward ear.
At the centerline is an I beam welded to the deck with two single barrel bitts.
Period.
Down the port side are three kevel cleats, evenly spaced, with single barrel bitts between.
The middle bitt is missing the forward and aft ear.
At the port side, that was the starboard side, I may have screwed up.
At the port side, there are three kevel cleats evenly spaced, and two bitts, two single barrel bitts, at the stern.
There are two twenty-four inch Spudwells, one to port, one to starboard.
Two single barrel bitts, one to port, one to starboard.
Two anchor fairleads, and two kevel cleats, with one single barrel bitt on the centerline.
Period.
On deck is a Manitowoc ringer crane.
The crane was not operated for the purpose of this survey.
Forward of the crane is the diesel power pack.
The power pack is pwoered by a Deutz air cooled diesel engine on a skid with hydraulic and fuel tank.
Hydraulic lines run under the deck in the number one center port and starboard voids to the port and starboard Lantec winches.
Winches have unknown length of cable on each.Forward on the main deck are two Conex boxes, one to port, one to starboard.
Outboard the power pack is a cylindrical fuel tank in a containment boom.
End of dictation on this tape.
