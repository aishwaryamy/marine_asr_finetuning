02740.
What's the best phone number?
Five zero eight nine six one eight four four nine.
You're, you're one of the licensed skippers on the boat is that correct?

I guess I'll ask your date of birth.
1-13-76.
Last four of your social?
six nine two four.
What kind of license do you hold?
1600 ton master.
600 ton?
1-6-0-0.
1-6-0-0.
1600 ton.
Mhm.
Master.
Is it US Coast Guard issued?
Yes.
How long have you been running this boat?
Four years, I want to say.
Sounds about right.
What happened, I guess is the easiest question, and then we can sort of pick and choose and find our way.
A collision.
An accident.
The impact was to which side of your boat?
Port.
Remember what time of day it was?
I am told it was 1:30.
AM?
That's what I'm told.
I was that by the cook.
When we were, recounting.
That's Neil?
Yeah, recounting everything.
Okay.
What were you doing at the time of the collision?
I was in the factory.
Which section of the factory?
Aft.
Is that the sorting line?
Yes.
Who was at the, who was at the helm?
Andrew.
I've talked to everybody in the crew except Neil, Patrick and Andrew so far, all the other guys.
Various people are off duty and most of them are on duty.
Correct.
I don't know if we need to identify with you each one, but most everybody is working at this time.
Yes, I believe there are three people are off.
Yeah, sounds about right.
Yeah.
What were you guys towing at this point or steaming, jogging, drifting?
When I left the wheel, he was steaming, but I'm not sure what he decided to, he wasn't sure if he was going to do another tow, so I don't know what he was doing for speed.
How long after you left the helm did this happen?
I woke him up at 12:15 so an hour and change.
dSo you're at the wheel, you're steaming for home?
Was I steaming?
I don't remember if I was steaming or not.
Maybe just jogging or?
I don't, I just don't remember, I'm sorry.
It makes sense that I would have been steaming, but I don't remember.
You mentioned you weren't sure if a decision had been made to make one more tow or not, or maybe that was being considered?
Well, we didn't know if we had a full, right, load.
And after all the time we wanted to go on with a full load.
We didn't want to go in like two freezers short, all right?
Or even a half freezer short.
Right, right.
We wanted it.
So you're going to process the rest of that last haul.
And see.
And see if you had any more room in the freezer.
Yeah.
At which point you would decide to make another tow.
Yeah.
So at the point of the collision, you're not sure if you were steaming, jogging, or drifting?
You just don't know.
I just don't know.
Okay.
Because when I came up I didn't, well when I came up we were out of gear.
Alright, so you wake Andrew up, he takes the wheel, you go to below and you're working the factory.
Mhm.
There's a collision.
Yes.
Did you hear anything before the collision?
Like a horn blaring?
Or you know like somebody shouting?
Or, you're in the factory you probably don't hear any other radio radio communications.
No, we don't have a new radio radar anything down there.
And you obviously can't hear from the wheelhouse.
No, do you didn't hear anything out of the ordinary up until the moment of impact?
No, he's picking away.
He's picking squid.
Yeah.
So must be pretty shocking when that happens.
I knew right happen right away.
Sure.
Yeah, right you how long you've been a captain?
Long time?
Been fishing 27 years.
I usually go as mate though.
I've been mate for like 15 years.
Mate captain.
You hear a noise like that from inside your ship, you kind of know, you've run into something or something's run into you.
Oh, God.
Rocks probably sound different than another ship.
Yeah, they're under.
Right, right.
So at that point, what, what, after the impact, what did you do?
I went flying up that aft stairway.
And?
And saw the, saw the boat scraping against the entrance, the ship scraping against the entrance.
You set up the aft exit, the, the aft hatch?
I went up the aft hatch.
Ok. And you saw the container ship?
Yep.
Scraping alongside.
Against, yeah, scraping, I mean, bending in.
The port side?
Mhm.
I saw the door entrance all the way till they were clear of, finished, had no more boat to hit.
Right, right, so the door you're talking about the forward door?
Entrance, yeah.
On the port side, that's what accesses into the.
The, watertight door, we'll call it for simplicity, how's that?
Right, right.
So you saw them at that point on your boat just kind of scraping along until they were clear?
Yes.
And that was it.
What'd you do then?
Then once they were clear, and I knew I wouldn't get hurt, I ran across the deck.
And then Andrew threw my daughter at me, and I went to survey the damage.
Exterior or were you back interior?
Just outside the door.
You couldn't open the door anymore.
So that whole like the whole rail along the port side, like that was all stove in?
Oh wow.
So you couldn't get in that door, that forward entrance, no?
We have no, you couldn't.
I tried to open that, I couldn't open it.
I'm sorry, you're shaking your head, but the recorder can't see your shaking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
No, I could not open it.
I tried to open the door.
I couldn't open it.
If someone had been standing here, they're smoking a cigarette, they would have died.
Right there.
And then the gear room where we keep our gear, that was all destroyed, like the wall.
There were some pictures, I guess, floating around in the interweb.
There's a view of the boat that's kind of like nose down in the water, not quite sunk yet, but taking on water you can tell.
And it's hard to see from the picture because it's kind of grainy and it's dark out.
But like the boat looked intact, your boat, but like just all crushed inward, sort of, like in on itself.
So there were obvious like holes.
You talking about the port side?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, I looked, and I said I don't see any damage.
I don't see any holes.
I'm looking for holes.
Right.
Just all pushed down.
Yeah.
After the impact or the collision and you're observing, trying to see what's wrong, was there any communication with the container ship after that afterward?
Andrew talked to them.
And what were you doing in this period of time?
Just trying to get my wits back, you know, recover my wits, I guess.
Assessing damage.
Assessing damage, yeah, and just trying to calm down.
Several of the guys recalled Pat down on the factory level, yep, like handing out life jackets and getting the crew kind of collected in the galley while he was assessing damage down there.
Andrew I think was back and forth between decks and then out of different compartments.
Where, like what kind of stuff were you doing at that point in time?
Like, let's say after the collision and before the evacuation that you guys evacuated the boat.
Well, I made the mayday call and then I was radio.
On the radio?
After the mayday call, I made the mayday call and then I was standing by the radio.
Okay.
Is that your question?
That's my question.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
And I can't even keep up with the notes.
So my notes are going to be terrible with this interview.
So at what point did you become aware that abandon ship was happening?
Who told you?
I was pretty, pretty much saw the way things were going.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I was trying to get, you know, the Coast Guard to come.
I guess there was some, I'm not sure because we had to, we didn't have radio, our radio couldn't communicate with the Coast Guard that far out.
Ok. And the Dyrsten also was saying, yeah, we can't get them either.
Ok.
So that research vessel was like conveying the messages for us.
Oh, alright.
Thank God they were out there.
Yeah, right.
So the, So I wanted the Coast Guard to come.
The Dyrsten?
The Dyrsten, yeah.
Do you know how it's spelled?
I wanna say D-Y-R-S-T-E-N, but don't quote me on that.
D-Y-R-S-T-E-N. And there was a, was it the Atlantic or Atlantis?
Maybe, a research RV, research vessel.
WHOI ship.
So they were in the immediate area, they were eight miles away.
They heard your mayday.
May day.
And they said, can we help?
And I said, well, are you the Coast Guard?
Because I didn't know what RV meant.
And they're like, no, we're RV.
And I'm like, why are you the Coast Guard?
And they said, no.
I said, well, can you try to get in touch with the Coast Guard for me?
And then and they did so they were able to relay, Yeah, radio communication, and then it sounded like there was some like, I don't know, like I said it was kind of intense, an intense situation.
Yeah.
So I was trying to, like I really wanted the Coast Guard to come but it seemed like there was some question about whether or not they were going to come, but I could be wrong about that.
But, sometimes it takes them a while to figure out if they need to come, decide they were gonna come, I couldn't yeah, I was like, well, the guy was, I said, well, you know, is the Coast Guard gonna come?
And he said, well, you know, we're right here.
And I said, well, I was really hoping that, you know, the Coast Guard would come.
Yeah.
So, yeah, but they came.
They did, yeah.
So I think that like they're trying to assess what's happened and if they need to respond or not.
Like they need to know, they need enough information to decide if we come out or not.
You're not having a direct communication with them, so being relayed through the other boat.
So that's kind of, that could kind of be confusing.
But thank God that they were there.
Thank God they were there.
Because of the other fishing boat in the area, he couldn't get through either.
I wonder if it's like...
It's like a dead zone.
Is it?
Yeah, I tried to call before the Coast Guard down there and you just can't get through.
That's scary.
Yeah.
You're talking about radio.
Radio VHF.
Right, right.
Yeah, like maybe you're just between two, Yeah, towers and there's not enough boost in the signal, I don't know.
I don't know, maybe he has a more modern radio or something, the research guy?
Like some kind of like, microwave radio satellite phone.
I don't know.
Whatever, yeah.
Maybe they, you know, they could be up higher, and maybe their signal can carry just a little bit further because they're up higher, I don't have any idea.
But I saw the way things were.
I saw the direction we were heading.
Yeah.
Were there any issues, malfunctions with communications, navigation, or or, illumination on your boat before the incident?
There were some issues with the gyro compass.
Okay.
Yeah.
And what was the other question?
Communications.
Communications.
No.
Receiving of AIS.
We couldn't, we weren't receiving AIS.
Not receiving AIS.
Yeah.
He tried to get Manny to come and he tried to get a few other people to come and fix it, but we weren't able to get it.
You're transmitting okay?
We transmitted but we couldn't receive.
And this was known before the trip?
Yeah.
Okay.
What was the issue with the gyro compass?
Which I may not understand your explanation but I'm gonna ask it anyway.
It's not always showing the correct course, you know, like, I don't, I think it's, I don't, I don't actually know, but it doesn't always show the right course.
I've never, this is the first time I've used one personally.
You're using your radio to communicate with these other boats nearby, so obviously that's working.
Yeah.
Do you guys have a plotter?
Yes, we do.
What kind of system is that on?
Oh, we have Noveltec, and... what was the other one?
We have like a, Windows, Wimplot, and the Catch, Catch something or other.
I don't know, just has Catch on the button, and I don't know actually though.
But all that stuff was functional.
Yeah.
Deck lights, work lights, all that, you know, the big spotlights when you guys are all lit up at night, right?
Like all your lights are working?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Navigational lights.
Sorry.
I don't really know what to.
Out of questions?
Yeah, could be out of questions, I don't know.
Like I've heard from everybody, you know, like the below decks, what they saw, what they observed, what was happening, you were mostly topside at this point?
After the collision, I didn't return.
You did not go back.
I did not go back.
I took some time to collect myself, and then I held, I was sat at the wheel afterwards.
And there is a separate entrance from the deck to the wheelhouse, if I remember correctly.
Yeah, from outside.
Right, because the port side entrance was stove in.
Oh yeah, I tried to open it.
So you're able to get to the wheelhouse, that's good.
And you stayed in the wheelhouse, whatever was happening down below.
Yeah, I just went down to put some diapers and a diaper bag for my baby when I knew we were gonna leave.
Can't even imagine.
Oh, she couldn't let me put clothes on her.
I was trying to put clothes on her, worm clothes on her and she was like rahhhhh, I finally had to just put on a diaper.
Like as a toddler will do, yeah.
I don't wanna get dressed right now.
Like, you have to listen to mom!
I'm not getting dressed right now.
Anything else you can think to add?
Nope.
You guys were on your way home, like maybe one more tow, maybe not.
Right.
The end of the trip.
Yeah.
What a kick in the ass.
I know.
Who is the, like, who's the, who's the, the captain?
He is.
Andrew is?
Like in real life?
Yeah.
He's the captain, I'm the mate.
You're the mate.
But we share navigational duties.
You're, you're a fully qualified captain, but he's the captain, you're the main.
It's funny, I explained it awkwardly to the Coast Guard like a couple years ago, our situation, and the Coast Guard guy came back with.
So he's the owner and you're the licensed captain and you share navigational responsibilities.
So that's just what I've been saying.
He liked how it sounded.
He said it.
So I said it back to him the other day.
Right.
Because Andrew's a fishing captain, but he's not like a licensed skipper like you are.
Right.
Right.
He's the owner.
You're the captain.
We share navigational duties.
It's a good answer.
Yeah.
That's what the Coast Guard told you.
That's what he told me.
like, well, next time they ask me, that's what I'm gonna tell them.
Yeah, yeah.
Right, I'm sure there'll be a bazillion other questions to ask, though the lawyers will get involved here shortly.
Is this gonna be like a long, like, like am I gonna have to be available for years and years?
Yeah, yeah.
Nuh unh, really?
Very possibly.
Yeah.
But there was a collision at sea.
I get it.
And one boat has sunk.
I understand.
And the other boat may have damage, I'm not even sure yet.
Yeah.
There's two parties involved, you know, like two vessels, two owners, two insurance companies, and you know, like a lot of financial exposure, this could go on for quite a while.
Could.
Yeah.
Maybe not.
You never know.
But yeah, you'll need to be available.
Okay.
Possibly for years.
Wow.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Who knows?
Who knows?
I'm just curious.
Yeah.
So I can't think of anything else to ask you.
Truthfully, I'm starting to get a little brain dead.
Like I've talked to 10 or 12 people.
Right, the crew.
Well, maybe not 12, but 8 or 10 guys and you know, like, I'm not even sure who I've asked what questions any longer.
Yeah, maybe you need a break.
Well, I'm not trying to play like the sympathy card because you guys have gone through something.
Well, you might need, you might need a break.
Yeah, my brain's starting to get a little squashy.
Yeah.
Maybe some lunch.
Well, I just ate.
I have a second breakfast actually.
Oh, good for you.
I have your phone number.
Everybody's okay?
Yes.
I believe your Coast Guard interview is scheduled for Thursday coming up next week, today's Saturday, Thursday next week.
Where does that take place?
I think it's a phone interview.
Okay.
But I don't know.
It could be at the Coast Guard base in Boston, or New Bedford, or the lawyer's office, or just wherever you are on your phone.
Okay.
I don't know.
I would suggest for your consideration that you probably don't want to talk to anybody outside of the immediate circle of people until you've had a chance to discuss things with the company lawyer about what you should talk about to who.
So I can do that before I talk to the Coast Guard?
Oh sure.
Okay, yeah, let's do it.
I don't need to be saying stupid stuff.
Well, you know, like, a zillion people are going to call you between now and Thursday.
Yeah.
Right?
Do you have your phone?
No.
Andrew, he used it as a flashlight and lost it.
And his phone, I've seen already here in the hotel.
I saved his phone, and put it in a ziploc.
You saved his phone.
It looks like something that's been dropped off a 10 story building.
He'll keep it for another two years like that probably.
And your phone's probably nice and clean.
Oh yeah, brand new.
With a case on it, brand new.
Right, so you're going to have a million questions from a million people.
You know, like, this is all very super legally sensitive stuff at this point.
I understand.
I think you might not want to share too much information.
I do not want to share too much.
I have not told the crew very much.
Well they asked me what happened and I just told them that I was so busy, I yelled at Andrew and then I just didn't want to talk to him and then I was making a mayday.
So which is the story, that's what happened.
Right, what happened?
I don't know.
We hit something.
What do I want to sit and discuss it?
It already happened and I'm mad about it, so I just gotta calm down.
Something hit us or we hit something.
All right, I don't have any other questions for you right now, except to ask you if everything you've said is the truth to the best of your memory.
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not sure if I identified myself.
I know you know who I am, so sometimes I forget to do that.
You gave me your name.
My name is Jeff DuBois, claim investigator with Marine Safety Consultants, and Maritime Claims Associates.
Today is October 29, 2022.
We've been meeting here today at the Hampton Inn in Shinkateague, Virginia.
And the current time is 12 o'clock in the afternoon, lunchtime.
Any questions, Sarah?
No.
Thank you.
Thank you.
